<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Secretum</h2><p>By writing what he called a &#x201c;secret book&#x201d; &#x2013; taking the shape of a conversation between himself and St Augustine &#x2013; Petrarch aimed to compose a cathartic text which would alleviate his spiritual crisis and help him make further inroads towards knowledge and fulfilment. At once an intimate repository of his most personal thoughts and emotions and a literary masterpiece dealing with universal issues, Secretum &#x2013; Petrarch&#x2019;s best-known work in Latin &#x2013; is a fascinating and pioneering example of the autobiographical genre.</p><p>Petrarch (1304&#x2013;1374) is universally regarded as the forefather of Italian humanism, and his work was an immense source of inspiration to many early English poets.</p><h2>Between the Acts (Oxford World&#39;s Classics (Paperback))</h2><p>The author&#39;s last novel, written during the early years of World War II, was completed just before her death. The action takes place on a single summer&#39;s day at a country house, Pointz Hall, in the heart of England. In the garden the villagers are presenting their annual pageant - on this occasion scenes from English history up to and including &#34;ourselves, &#34; the audience, in June 1939. During the interludes the inhabitants of Pointz Hall, the Olivers, their guests, and the villagers have tea, stroll, and talk. There is an intense interplay among the unhappy Isa Oliver, her handsome husband, Giles, whom she loves and hates, and a guest, Mrs. Manresa, who is pursuing him. A storm interrupts the final tableau, and the pageant comes to an end. The performers and the audience depart to resume their ordinary lives and Isa and Giles to confront each other.</p><p>Unlike most previous editions, the Cambridge edition returns to the final version of the novel as Woolf left it. With detailed explanatory notes, a chronology and an informative critical introduction, this volume will allow scholars to develop a fuller understanding of Woolf&#39;s last work.Initially overshadowed by Virginia Woolf's death and the Second World War, "Between the Acts" is now judged to be among the author's most challenging and subtle works. It is about many things, including marriage and jealousy, language and memory, artists, arts and audiences, and a society on the brink of war. In her early plans she called "Between the Acts" a medley. Included in the mix are literary genres she had written about throughout her career, echoes of her own works and allusions that range from the classics to popular songs. As the extensive notes to this edition show, in writing "Between the Acts "Woolf drew upon a capacious memory filled by a lifetime of reading, writing, listening and observing.<br><p>"Between the Acts" is both Woolf's last novel and the first of her works to be published posthumously. The first English edition was set from her final typescript, edited by Leonard Woolf for publication by the Hogarth Press soon after her death. The text of the Shakespeare Head Press edition is that of the first English edition emended on the basis of a comparison of it with her final typescript. The result is a text that is closer to "Between the Acts" as Virginia Woolf left it than are any earlier editions.</p></p><h2>James Baldwin: The Last Interview: and other Conversations (The Last Interview Series)</h2><p><b>Never before available, the unexpurgated last interview with James Baldwin</b><br><br>&#x201c;I was not born to be what someone said I was. I was not born to be defined by someone else, but by myself, and myself only.&#x201d; When, in the fall of 1987, the poet Quincy Troupe traveled to the south of France to interview James Baldwin, Baldwin&#x2019;s brother David told him to ask Baldwin about everything&#x2014;Baldwin was critically ill and David knew that this might be the writer&#x2019;s last chance to speak at length about his life and work.<br><br>The result is one of the most eloquent and revelatory interviews of Baldwin&#x2019;s career, a conversation that ranges widely over such topics as his childhood in Harlem, his close friendship with Miles Davis, his relationship with writers like Toni Morrison and Richard Wright, his years in France, and his ever-incisive thoughts on the history of race relations and the African-American experience.<br><br>Also collected here are significant interviews from other moments in Baldwin&#x2019;s life, including an in-depth interview conducted by Studs Terkel shortly after the publication of <i>Nobody Knows My Name</i>. These interviews showcase, above all, Baldwin&#x2019;s fearlessness and integrity as a writer, thinker, and individual, as well as the profound struggles he faced along the way.</p><p><b>JAMES BALDWIN (</b>1922&#x2013;1987) was a novelist, essayist, and activist. He is best known for the novels <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i> (1953) and <i>Giovanni&#x2019;s Room</i> (1956), and the collections <i>Nobody Knows My Name</i> (1961) and <i>The Fire Next Time</i> (1963). He was an important figure in the civil rights movement, and his books addressing the African-American and gay experiences have influenced generations of writers.&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re hoping to find holiday reading that is as educational as it is entertaining, look no further than [this] new book of discussions with legendary intellectual James Baldwin.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<b><i>Vogue.com</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Resonant...

He manages to be concrete, particular . . . yet also transcendent, arching above the immediacy of an occasion or crisis.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>A departure from Evelyn Waugh's normally comic theater, <b>Brideshead Revisited</b> concerns the tale of Charles Ryder, a captain in the British Army in post-World War I England. Unlike Waugh's previous narrators, Ryder is an intelligent man, looking back on much of his life from his current post in Oxford. He strikes a special friendship with Lord Sebastian Flyte as the setting moves to the Brideshead estate and a baroque castle that recalls England's prior standing in the world. Ryder falls for Flyte's sister while families, politics and religions collide. What makes the book extraordinary is Waugh's sharp, vivid style and his use of dialect and minor characters. This is one of Waugh's finest accomplishments and a superb book.8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Veterinary Dentistry: A Team Approach</h2><p><p>From radiology and anesthesia to patient needs and client education, this handy full-color guide covers everything you need to know about veterinary dentistry.

Here are two of his best-known and best-loved tales: &#34;Fishke the Lame&#34; and &#34;Benjamin the Third.&#34;</p><p>Dan Miron, a professor of Hebrew at both Columbia University and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, explains in a scholarly 70-page introduction that Mendele, the book peddler, was not so much a pseudonym used by Sholem Yankev Abramovitsh as an alternative identity. Abramovitsh, already an established writer of sophisticated Hebrew criticism and short stories, created the character of Mendele in 1863 to allow him to write in vernacular Yiddish, which at that time was considered a barrier to modernity by intellectual cosmopolitan Jews. Later, Mendele&#39;s hilarious, digressive, and compassionate tales were recognized as classics of the language. Presented here are marvelous translations of the exploits of Benjamin the Third, a Jewish Don Quixote; and Fishke the Lame, a long-suffering beggar.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Hebrew, Yiddish</p><h2>Atomic Adventures: Secret Islands, Forgotten N-Rays, and Isotopic Murder: A Journey into the Wild World of Nuclear Science</h2><p><p><strong>The latest investigation&nbsp;from acclaimed nuclear engineer and author James Mahaffey unearths forgotten nuclear endeavors throughout history that were sometimes hair-brained, often risky, and always fascinating.</strong></p> Whether you are a scientist or a poet, pro-nuclear energy or staunch opponent, conspiracy theorist or pragmatist, James Mahaffey's books have served to open up the world of nuclear science like never before. With clear explanations of some of the most complex scientific endeavors in history, Mahaffey's new book looks back at the atom's wild, secretive past and then toward its potentially bright future.<br><br> Mahaffey unearths lost reactors on far flung Pacific islands and trees that were exposed to active fission that changed gender or bloomed in the dead of winter. He explains why we have nuclear submarines but not nuclear aircraft and why cold fusion doesn't exist. And who knew that radiation counting was once a fashionable trend? Though parts of the nuclear history might seem like a fiction mash-up, where cowboys somehow got a hold of a reactor, Mahaffey's vivid prose holds the reader in thrall of the infectious energy of scientific curiosity and ingenuity that may one day hold the key to solving our energy crisis or sending us to Mars. 16 pages of color images</p><p>James Mahaffey was a senior research scientist at the Georgia Tech Research Institute where he worked under contract for&nbsp;the Defense Nuclear Agency, the National Ground Intelligence Center,&nbsp;the Air Force Air Logistics Center, and Georgia Power Company. He is the author of Atomic Awakening&nbsp;and&nbsp;Atomic Accidents&nbsp;and&nbsp;lives in Atlanta, Georgia.&#x201c;A rewarding book. H.G. Wells would have been fascinated by <em>Atomic Adventures</em>, especially by the ways its cast of scientists&#x2015;who range from authentic experts to the shadiest of con artists&#x2015;have tried to make use of atomic energy in war and in peace. Mahaffey, a former research scientist at Georgia Tech, is a knowledgeable narrator who plainly loves his subject. He knows how to tell a good story and, no less important, has an eye for unfamiliar and revealing details. An enlightening read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In some ways, <em>Atomic Adventures</em> is reminiscent of historian Richard Rhodes&#x2019;s book <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em>. But Mahaffey offers more than just history. He sets out to teach his readers about the science behind the stories. In a culture fixated on accomplishment, it&#x2019;s important to talk about the things that didn&#x2019;t work. What <em>Atomic Adventures</em> does well is to celebrate the full arc of science: the good, the bad, and the quirky.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Science</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Did you mourn the ending of Simon Winchester&#x2019;s <em>Pacific</em>?

It is suitable for students from any discipline but is particularly aimed at students studying film and literature as it examines issues common to both subjects such as realism, illusionism, narration, point of view, style, semiotics, psychoanalysis and multiculturalism. It also includes coverage of theorists common to both, Barthes, Lacan and Bakhtin among others. <p> Robert Stam, renowned for his clarity of writing, will also include studies of cinema specialists providing readers with a depth of reference not generally available outside the field of film studies itself. Other material covered includes film adaptations of works of literature and analogies between literary and film criticism.</p></p><p>A lively &amp; provoking introduction to film theory, the author examines genres &amp; issues central to the study of both media, realism, illusionism, narration, point of view, style, semiotics, psychoanalysis &amp; multiculturalism.<b>Robert Stam</b> is Professor in the Cinema Studies Department at New York University. His many books include <i>Film Theory: An Introduction</i> (Blackwell Publishers, 1999), <i>Tropical Multiculturalism: A Comparative History of Race in Brazilian Cinema and Culture</i> (1997), <i>Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media</i> with Ella Shohat (1994), which won the Katherine Singer Kovocs 'Best Film Book Award'; and <i>Subversive Pleasures: Bakhtin, Cultural Criticism, and Film</i> (1992).</p><h2>The Essential Tao</h2><p>Composed of two ancient Taoist classics that are proving remarkably appealing and relevant today, The Essential Tao delves into topics such as politics and economy, managing stress and health, and psychology and mysticism. &#34;It is magnificent and grandiose, outrageous and funny, sharp and acerbic, dreamy and playful&#34;.--David Steindl-Rast, OSB.</p><p>Thomas Cleary presents original translations of the two ancient Chinese texts that describe the essential philosophy and practice of the Tao, or "universal way." The <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, Lao-tzu's classic anthology of sayings, poems, and proverbs, appears here in its entirety; Cleary's excellent, detailed notes to each of the 81 stanzas illuminate the more difficult verses and unfamiliar ideas. The first seven, or "inner" chapters of the <i>Chuang-Tzu</i>, those containing the essence of the Taoist master Chuang-tzu's teachings, are also presented, with accompanying notes explaining the philosophy and significance of the symbolic stories. Readers already acquainted with the two texts will find renewed enjoyment in the directness and simplicity of Cleary's translations, which are particularly pleasing to modern ears while losing none of the nuances of the originals. The well-known opening lines of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, for example, are given new life: "A way can be a guide, but not a fixed path; names can be given, but not permanent labels." And there is a clarity in the passages from the <i>Chuang-Tzu</i> not often found in other interpretations: "Who knows the unspoken explanation, the unexpressed Way? Among those who do know, this is called the celestial storehouse: we can pour into it without filling it, we can draw from it without exhausting it; and yet we don't know where it comes from." The subject matter of both texts ranges widely, from politics and economy to psychology and mysticism, addressing the needs and interests of a diverse readership. No less relevant today than when they were written more than 2,000 years ago, there is a "perennial currency" to these writings achieved by few of the world's great books. Cleary's readable introduction and notes provide an elegant frame that complements the quiet grandeur of these important texts. <i>--Uma Kukathas</i><p>Thomas Cleary is the preeminent translator of classic Eastern texts, including <em>The Essential Tao, The Essential Confucius, The Secret of the Golden Flower,</em> and the bestselling <em>The Art of War.</em></p></p><h2>The Call of the Wild</h2><p>When gold was discovered in the Yukon in 1896, Jack London caught the fever and rushed off to the northlands to try his luck. When he returned home, he had not mined an ounce of gold but brought back a greater treasure -- vivid recollections of rugged life in the frozen wastelands. London converted his experiences into exciting adventure tales, including <i>The Call of the Wild,</i> which has been called his masterpiece. It tells the story of the magnificent dog Buck, who is a loyal pet until cruel men make him a pawn in their search for the gold of the Klondike. Brutally treated, Buck finds the blood of his wolf ancestors rising within him and breaks free to roam the Alaskan wilderness as leader of a ferocious pack.</p><p>&#34;A lively and expressive reading of this riveting story of the far north.&#34;<p> A best-seller from its first publication in 1903, <em>The Call of the Wild</em> tells the story of Buck, a big mongrel dog who is shipped from his comfortable life in California to Alaska, where he must adapt to the harsh life of a sled dog during the Klondike Gold Rush. The narrative recounts Buck&#x2019;s brutal obedience training, his struggle to meet the demands of human masters, and his rise to the position of lead sled dog as a result of his superior physical and mental qualities. Finally, Buck is free to respond to the &#x201c;call&#x201d; of the wilderness. Over a hundred years after its publication, Jack London&#x2019;s &#x201c;dog story&#x201d; retains the enduring appeal of a classic. </p> <p> This Broadview Edition includes a critical introduction that explores London&#x2019;s life and legacy and the complex scientific and psychological ideas drawn upon by London in writing the story. The appendices include material on the Klondike, Darwin&#x2019;s writings on dogs, other contemporary writings on instinct and atavism, and maps of the regions in which the story takes place. </p></p><h2>The Art of Public Speaking, 9th Edition</h2><p>Whether a novice or an experienced speaker, every student will learn how to be a better public speaker through Lucas' clear explanations and thorough coverage.

It was thus that Louise Melville was always to remember the house with the high wall and the adventure connected with it. Antonia was to remember it, too, but not so vividly, for really and truly it was Lou's adventure. Lou was the adventurous one.</p> <p>The house with the high wall was within five minutes' walk of their own house (the house in which they had been born and in which they lived with their father and mother), but, whereas their own house was one of many, all exactly alike, and was situated in a square with a small and very sooty garden in front, the house with the high wall stood alone, surrounded by a solid gray stone wall and half hidden by trees. In the summer a laburnum flung careless streams of golden blossom over the top of the wall and a snow-white hawthorn tree filled the air with sweetness.</p> <p>The children often walked around that way in the afternoon, and they used to linger as they passed the tall wooden door in the hope that it would open and give them a glimpse of the garden and the house, but Nannie did not approve of lingering here. She never said anything but always hurried them on...</p> <p>Lou and Tonia did not ask why, of course, for they were aware that Nannie would not tell them. Nannie was an adept at the art of turning questions aside-questions that she could not or would not answer.</p> <p>"P'raps an ogre lives there," Tonia said. "An ogre who eats children for his breakfast."</p> <p>"Or p'raps a wicked magician who would turn us into frogs," countered Lou with relish.</p> <p>They did not really believe in ogres and magicians, for they were sensible children, but it was fun to pretend to believe in these monsters of iniquity and it was an absorbing topic of conversation.</p> <p>"Grown-ups are queer," said Tonia, referring to Nannie's inexplicable behavior.</p> <p>"Yes," agreed Lou. "Yes, they get queer ideas. I think Nannie must have gotten a queer idea about the house with the high wall."</p> <p>"Mother has it, too," said Tonia, nodding. "Mother wouldn't let me look at the house when we drove past yesterday."</p> <p>One blustery day toward the end of March, the east wind was sweeping through the streets of Edinburgh, raising the dust in clouds and playing all sorts of impish tricks with the hats and skirts of the citizens. The children were out with Nannie as usual, but there was an unusual feeling in Lou's heart. Perhaps it was the sunshine and the breeze, or perhaps it was the fact that the flower shop windows were full of daffodils, showing that spring was really on its way. Whatever it was, Lou's heart felt light and her feet wanted to dance...and when she got to the corner of the high gray wall she took to her heels and ran. Tonia followed, of course, she always followed Lou, and Nannie was left panting along behind.</p> <p>The children stopped at the big brown door and looked at each other, smiling.</p> <p>"I won," said Lou, breathlessly.</p> <p>"You-started-first," said Tonia, more breathlessly still.</p> <p>"You could have started first if you'd wanted-"</p> <p>"But I didn't know," began Tonia in reproachful tones.</p> <p>At this moment the big brown door swung open and a lady appeared. She stepped out into the street and looked up and down-as if she were looking for someone. She was dressed in a soft blue coat with gray furs and a little hat made of gray feathers, but it was her face that riveted the eyes of Tonia and Lou; her face was beautiful. It was pink and white like the Dresden china lady in the drawing room cabinet, and her eyes were bright and brown and sparkling with life.</p> <p>The lady stopped and smiled. "Two dear little mice!" she exclaimed. She might have said more-she looked as if she were going to say more-but Nannie was just behind and swept the children on.</p> <p>"The idea!" said Nannie under her breath.</p> <p>They talked about the lady all the way home, walking along in front of Nannie very sedately.</p> <p>"What a lovely smell she had!" whispered Lou.</p> <p>"It was violets," said Tonia, whispering back.</p> <p>"She was like a picture-"</p> <p>"Like a queen-that's what I thought."</p> <p>"She called us mice."</p> <p>"Because of our gray coats, of course."</p> <p>For days on end they talked of nothing else, for the sudden appearance of the picture lady and her unusual beauty had kindled their imaginations; unfortunately they had been so entranced that neither of them had looked in through the open door, so the house with the high wall was as mysterious as ever-perhaps even more mysterious.</p> <p>"She lives there, of course," said Lou. "It must be lovely if she lives there. How I wish I had remembered to look!"</p> <p>Tonia said nothing for she was content with the mystery. It was pleasant to speculate, to make up stories about the garden and the house and the beautiful picture lady who lived there...but Lou was different. Lou always wanted to know.</p> <p>It was the end of May or perhaps the beginning of June when Nannie went home for the weekend. She went home to see her mother who was "getting on" (as Nannie put it), and while she was away the children's mother looked after them and Maggie, the housemaid, put them to bed. Maggie was young and enjoyed having games with the children, so, although they were fond of Nannie, her absence was a pleasant change.</p> <p>On Sunday afternoon, Lou and Tonia went down to the drawing room dressed in their best frocks-blue Liberty smocks, the color of their eyes. Mrs. Melville intended to have them with her for tea, but after about twenty minutes of their company she changed her mind, for they were in a tiresome sort of mood and she could not be bothered with them. If only one of them had been a boy, thought Mrs. Melville, looking at her daughters regretfully, or even if one of them were really interesting; they were both rather dull. The children of Mrs. Melville's friends were bright and entertaining and frequently made amusing remarks, but neither Lou nor Tonia ever said anything worth repeating.</p> <p>"I think you might go upstairs and play with the dollhouse," suggested Mrs. Melville. "You'd like that, wouldn't you? And I'll tell Maggie to take your tea up to the nursery."</p> <p>"Do you love Mother?" asked Tonia, as they toiled upstairs together.</p> <p>"Why, of course," replied Lou in horrified tones. "It would be frightfully wicked not to love Mother. You love her, don't you?"</p> <p>"Of course," said Tonia hastily...but did she? Perhaps she was frightfully wicked. How could you be sure?</p> <p>"And Father," continued Lou in earnest tones. "You love Father, don't you?"</p> <p>"Oh, of course," agreed Tonia. She hesitated and then added in a doubtful voice, "But we don't see him often, do we?"</p> <p>"He buys your clothes, Tonia. He buys your food. You would starve if Father didn't buy you things."</p> <p>"Yes, of course," said Tonia for the third time, but without much conviction.</p> <p>They had arrived at the nursery. Tonia opened the dollhouse, but Lou ran across to the window and leaned out. There were bars across the window, but you could get your head between the bars-if Nannie was not there-and you could look down into the street, far below. People were walking along, dressed in their Sunday clothes, and it was amusing because you could see their hats and a dumpy sort of figure beneath. A dog ran across the street and a black-and-white cat sprang onto the railing of the garden and crouched there, spitting with rage. There was a hawthorn tree in the garden, and the afternoon sun was shining on the snow-white blossoms with a golden light.</p> <p>"Let's go out," said Lou.</p> <p>"Alone!" exclaimed Tonia in amazement.</p> <p>"Why not?" demanded Lou. Her cheeks were suddenly pink, and her eyes were sparkling. Her very hair seemed full of excitement; a few moments ago it had been lying flat with boredom, but now her golden curls were bobbing and dancing as if they were alive. "What could happen to us, Tonia?" she continued. "I suppose you're frightened of getting lost or something. We always go for a walk in the afternoons-it's good for us. I'll take care of you," added Lou grandly.</p> <p>Five minutes later the hall door opened, and two little girls in little blue frocks came out and walked sedately down the steps. Nothing had been arranged about the direction of their walk, but neither of them showed any hesitation. They turned to their left and proceeded upon their way, hand in hand.</p> <p>The wall was just as mysterious as ever, and the brown door was shut. Lou and Tonia walked past very slowly, turned at the corner, and walked back.</p> <p>"It won't open," said Tonia, breaking the silence. "I know it won't open; I've got a sort of feeling-"</p> <p>Lou said nothing. She reached up and pulled the bell. Far in the distance, there was a jangling noise that died away into silence.</p> <p>"Lou!"</p> <p>"I had to. I just had to, Tonia."</p> <p>"But what will you say?"</p> <p>"I don't know-but I must see inside," declared Lou breathlessly.</p> <p>They waited for a few moments and then they heard footsteps approaching and the door swung open...it was the lady they had seen before, the picture lady. Today she was all in pale gray with a string of pearls around her neck, and her dark hair was waved and curled.</p> <p>The lady looked at her visitors in some surprise and then she smiled. "It's the two little mice!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>Lou and Tonia were dumb. They walked into the garden, and the door was shut behind them. It was not a big garden, but it was even more wonderful than they had imagined, for it was full of sunshine and flowers. There was a paved courtyard with a pool in the middle, and all around the paved space was high rockery, covered with pink and yellow and purple flowers; they looked like colored waterfalls streaming down between the stones. At one side was a swinging garden seat with a gaily striped red and white canopy, and in front of it was a tea table with a white lace cloth and silver that sparkled in the sun. A fat lady was sitting in the swinging seat and a young man in white flannels was sitting near her in a deck chair, reading a paper.</p> <p>Lou and Tonia stood there, hand in hand, and gazed about them.</p> <p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the young man, throwing down his paper. "Good heavens, where did you find them, Mother?"</p> <p>"They're perfect," declared the fat lady, holding up a lorgnette.</p> <p>"Yes, quite perfect," agreed the picture lady, laughing to herself in a pleased way. "I thought you'd like them, Daisy. Wasn't it clever of me to produce them for you on a dull Sunday afternoon?"</p> <p>"It's never dull when you're about," declared the young man.</p> <p>"It was very clever of you, Wanda," declared the fat lady.</p> <p>"They're two little mice, you know," said the picture lady, nodding. "Two dear little mice."</p> <p>"Not mice, Wanda," objected the fat lady.</p> <p>"No," agreed the young man. "Aunt Daisy is right. They aren't mice. I can't quite make up my mind what they are-babes in the wood, perhaps."</p> <p>"They're Alices in Wonderland," said Aunt Daisy, closing her lorgnette with a snap.</p> <p>A short silence ensued. It was broken by the young man. "Can they talk?" he inquired in a grave, interested voice.</p> <p>"I don't think so," replied the picture lady. "But they don't have to talk, do they? I mean, they're so entrancing to look at."</p> <p>"Entrancing," agreed Aunt Daisy with a sigh. "And how fortunate they are! They go together so beautifully, don't they? One fair and one dark-and they both have dark blue eyes and rose-leaf complexions. When we were young, you were so much fairer."</p> <p>"I couldn't help it, Daisy," said the picture lady regretfully.</p> <p>Lou and Tonia had never heard this sort of conversation before (it was entirely different from the conversation of their mother's friends), but the whole adventure was so strange, so different from everyday life, that nothing would have surprised them.</p> <p>"Of course we can talk," said Lou, waking suddenly from the daze into which she had fallen.</p> <p>"They can talk!" exclaimed the young man in amazement.</p> <p>"Perhaps they can eat and drink," suggested Aunt Daisy.</p> <p>The young man immediately rose, produced two cushions, and, putting them on the broad stone rim of the pool, invited the children to sit down. The picture lady poured out two cups of tea and offered them a plate of chocolate �clairs.</p> <p>"We usually start with bread and butter," said Lou, doubtfully.</p> <p>"We always start with �clairs," said the young man gravely. "You see we haven't been very well brought up."</p> <p>"Speak for yourself, Jack," interposed Aunt Daisy with asperity. "Your mother and I were very well brought up. We always started with bread and butter, didn't we, Wanda?"</p> <p>"You can be too well brought up," replied her sister sadly. "I mean, you have so much further to backslide-"</p> <p>"But respectability is so dull-"</p> <p>"So difficult to achieve-"</p> <p>"Who wants to achieve it?" asked Jack. "Give me chocolate �clairs every time."</p> <p>The picture lady looked at him and smiled.</p> <p>"Are they twins, I wonder," said Aunt Daisy suddenly.</p> <p>"No, we aren't," declared Lou.</p> <p>"They aren't twins." Jack nodded. "As a matter of fact, I was pretty certain they were not. The pretty one is the elder."</p> <p>"They're both pretty," objected Aunt Daisy, "but of course I know what you mean. The fair one is more obviously pretty."</p> <p>"She's adorable," said Jack.</p> <p>"The dark one has better features," said his mother, "but you always prefer blonds."</p> <p>"Except one," put in Jack, smiling at her affectionately.</p> <p>"Sentimental nonsense," grumbled Aunt Daisy, handing in her cup for more tea.</p> <p>Neither Lou nor Tonia had any sense of social obligation, so they sat and ate chocolate �clairs and made no attempt to join in the conversation of their hosts. They listened, of course, in a slightly dazed manner, and not much of it escaped them. It was very pleasant in the garden, warm and bright. Bees buzzed among the flowers, and an occasional car passed by outside the high wall and hooted at the corner. Presently, the church bells began to ring for evening service, and the picture lady rose.</p> <p>"Are you going to church?" asked Lou.</p> <p>She smiled and shook her head. "It's time for you to go home, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Let's keep them," suggested Jack. "This is Liberty Hall. They would like to live here-"</p> <p>"Yes, let's keep them," agreed Aunt Daisy.</p> <p>"I'm afraid you can't," said Lou. "Mother might wonder where we had gone, and Nannie is coming home tomorrow-so you see-"</p> <p>"I see," said Jack sadly.</p> <p>Their hosts accompanied them to the door and shook hands with them. "Come back soon," said Jack.</p> <p>"Nannie won't let them," said the picture lady.</p> <p>Aunt Daisy laughed and said, "Oh, you know who they are!"</p> <p>Lou and Tonia walked home in silence, for there was so much to think about that they had no words at all. It was not until they had regained the familiar haven of the nursery and had seated ...</p></p><h2>Dui Yao: The Art of Combining Chinese Medicinals</h2><p>Based on 2,000 years of recorded clinical experience, certain combinations of Chinese medicinals work better than others.

Hofstadter</h2><p>Sparked by reading Jim Falen's beautiful English version of <i>Eugene Onegin</i> (published in 1992), Douglas Hofstadter presents a more liberal, distinctly American, colloquial version of the Alexander Pushkin classic. Hofstadter's version is entirely in so-called Onegin stanzas&#x201d; a unique sonnet form devised by Pushkin with a very intricate rhythmic and rhyming pattern. There is also a preface in Onegin stanzas, in which Hofstadter talks about Pushkin, his novel in verse, its form and content, the challenges of translating it into English and his deep admiration for Falen's version.This work will correspond with Pushkin's 200th anniversary; thus, it should be a timely and well accepted literary gem.</p><p>The supreme poet of the Russian language, Aleksandr Sergeyevich Pushkin has had a checkered existence in English. His prose, to be sure, has presented his translators with a less formidable set of hurdles. But Pushkin composed his masterpiece, <i>Eugene Onegin</i>, in a 14-line stanza of his own invention, with a slippery rhyme scheme and treacherously foursquare meter (i.e., iambic tetrameter, which tends to sound slightly singsong to English speakers). This has forced most of his translators--from Walter Arndt to James Falen to Charles Johnston--to shortchange form in favor of content. Vladimir Nabokov probably pushed this tendency as far as it could go, transforming Pushkin's poetry into perversely lumpy paragraphs (and enveloping the slim pickings of his translation in a jumbo-sized commentary). But nobody has managed to produce even a halfway-definitive version of <i>Eugene Onegin</i>.<p> Now Douglas Hofstadter, who's best known for <i>G�del, Escher, Bach</i>, has taken a shot at it. Certainly he's no stranger to translation theory--his 1997 book, <i>Le Ton Beau de Marot</i>, was a brilliant and unbuttoned meditation on the translator's art, with numerous detours into the hinterlands of cognitive science. Theory and practice are two different matters, however, as Hofstadter is quick to admit: "The thought seemed quite ridiculous: me, with such sparse knowledge of Russian, hoping to clamber up this formidable Everest of translation, a book often said to be next to untranslatable, and square at the center of the inner circle of Russian literature!" Clamber he did, however--and the result is a charming if uneven version of the poem, more beholden to Cole Porter and Ogden Nash than the poet's 19th-century peers. Several of Hofstadter's slangier couplets might have Nabokov spinning in his grave: "Did thus our party boy exhaust / Himself at games, at zero cost?" Still, he manages some of Pushkin's loop-the-loops very nicely: </p><blockquote> The air grew warm as days went flying,<br> And winter knew to call it quits.<br> Eugene gave up his versifying,<br> But not the ghost, and not his wits.<br> He's lent new life by buds aborning,<br> And first thing on some clear spring morning<br> He leaves his cloistered, small <i>ch�teau</i><br> Where, marmot-like, he'd braved the snow.<br> </blockquote> Clearly Hofstadter's take on the poem goes heavy on the sizzle and fails to capture much of Pushkin's elegant gravity. Still, it's a welcome addition to the ranks, a handsome present to the poet on the occasion of his 200th birthday--and, rather winningly, a linguistic labor of love. <i>--William Davies</i>In addition to Gdel, Escher, Bach, which won both the Pulitzer Prize and the American Book Award, Douglas R. Hofstadter is the author of several books, including Le Ton beau de Marot and Metamagical Themas. He is College Professor of Cognitive Science and Computer Science as well as the Director for the Center for Research on Concepts and Cognition at Indiana University in Bloomington.</p><h2>Outcome-Based Massage: Putting Evidence into Practice</h2><p><i>Outcome-Based MassageTM: Putting Evidence into Practice</i> (3rd edition) goes beyond an update of the content of the second edition.

And the way they remain constant. And what did you think love would be like? A summer day? The brambles in their places, and the long stretches of mud? Flowers in every field, in every garden, with their soft beaks and their pastel shoulders? On one street after another, the litter ticks in the gutter. In one room after another, the lovers meet, quarrel, sicken, break apart, cry out. One or two leap from windows. Most simply lean, exhausted, their thin arms on the sill. They have done all they could. The golden eagle, that lives not far from here, has perhaps a thousand tiny feathers flowing from the back of its head, each one shaped like an infinitely small but perfect spear.</p><p>In lines pulled taut by the tension between the silent beauty of nature and the poet&#39;s longing for words, Mary Oliver has again provided readers with plenty to think about. Consider &#34;Stars&#34;: &#34;How can I hope to be friends / with the hard white stars / whose flaring and hissing are not speech / but a pure radiance? / How can I hope to be friends / with the yawning spaces between them / where nothing, ever, is spoken?&#34; Yet Oliver does strike up a kind of friendship between nature&#39;s inexpressible beauty and the necessity and solace of language. She writes vividly of each, noting the way &#34;the sunlight and shadows are chasing each other,&#34; (from &#34;The Dog Has Run Off Again&#34;), in one instance, while elsewhere describing the excitement of writing poems: &#34;little curls little shafts / of letters words / little flames leaping&#34; (from &#34;Forty Years&#34;). Oliver is one of the most honored poets now writing in the English language, and, along with Wendell Berry, Gary Snyder, and A.R. Ammons, an important part of the revival we are seeing in contemporary pastoral poetry.A private person by nature, Mary Oliver (1935&#x2013;2019) gave very few interviews over the years. Instead, she preferred to let her work speak for itself. And speak it has, for the past five decades, to countless readers. Over the course of her long and illustrious career, Oliver received numerous awards. Her fourth book,&nbsp;<i>American Primitive</i>, won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1984. She also received the Shelley Memorial Award; a Guggenheim Fellowship; an American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Achievement Award; the Christopher Award and the L.L. Winship/PEN New England Award for <i>House of Light</i>; the National Book Award for<i> New and Selected Poems</i>; a Lannan Foundation Literary Award; and the New England Booksellers Association Award for Literary Excellence.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>A History of the Jews in New Mexico</h2><p><p>In this first history of the Jews in New Mexico--from the colonial period to the present day--the author continuously ties the Jewish experience to the evolution of the societies in which they lived and worked. The book begins with one of the least known but most fascinating aspects of New Mexico Jewry--the crypto-Jews who came north to escape the Mexican Inquisition. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the story is more familiar: German merchants settling in Las Vegas and Santa Fe and then coming to Albuquerque after the railroad arrived. To these accounts the author adds considerable nuance and detail, particularly on the place of Jews in smaller communities such as Roswell and Las Cruces as well as their social life and religious practice in a frontier region. </p><p>The discussion of the twentieth century focus particularly on the dynamics of Jewish development, and the ways in which that process differed in New Mexico.</p></p><p>In this first history of the Jews in New Mexico--from the colonial period to the present day--the author continuously ties the Jewish experience to the evolution of the societies in which they lived and worked.Henry J.

In the 1940s, he pushed the boundaries of the medium with his acclaimed weekly comic strip <em>The Spirit</em>, and with the publication of <em>A Contract with God</em> in 1978, he created a new medium altogether: the graphic novel. It was unlike anything seen before, heralding an era when serious cartoonists were liberated from the limiting confines of the comic strip. Eisner&#x2019;s work was a shining example of what comics could be: as inventive, moving, and complex as any literary art form.</p><p>Eisner considered himself &#x201c;a graphic witness reporting on life, death, heartbreak, and the never-ending struggle to prevail.&#x201d; <em>A Contract with God</em> begins with a gripping tale that mirrors the artist&#x2019;s real-life tragedy, the death of his daughter. Frimme Hersh, a devout Jew, questions his relationship with God after the loss of his own beloved child. Hersh&#x2019;s crisis is intertwined with the lives of the other unforgettable denizens of Eisner&#x2019;s iconic Dropsie Avenue, a fictionalized version of the quintessential New York City street where he came of age at the height of the Depression.</p><p>This centennial edition showcases Eisner&#x2019;s singular visual style in new high-resolution scans of his original art, complete with an introduction by Scott McCloud and an illuminating history of Eisner&#x2019;s seminal work. Now readers can experience the legendary book that launched a unique art form and reaffirmed Will Eisner as one of the great pioneers of American graphic storytelling.</p></p><p>Four powerful dramas recall tenement life in 1930s New York--an absolute must for fans of Bernard Malamud, Philip Roth,and Isaac Singer.

Each person who experienced the Holocaust - whether victim, witness, resuer, or descendant - has a unique story to tell. Selections for this anthology include fiction (both short stories and excepts from novels), poetry, historical accounts, biographical sketches, and drama. Each entry is preceded by a brief biographical note about the author and an introduction. In addition, each chapter opens with material that provides historical context for the selections that follow.</p><p>This comprehensive anthology of Holocaust experiences and hatred uses poetry, fiction, nonfiction and drama to bring alive the images and experiences of the event. Courage as well as cruelty are forces explored through this collection of literature from victims, witnesses and descendants: the result blends historical insights with first-person meaning and will prove especially important to future generations. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Elementary Statistics Using Excel</h2><p>Normal 0 false false false KEY BENEFIT: Elementary Statistics Using Excel, Fourth Edition, offers a complete introduction to basic statistics, featuring extensive instruction on the use of Excel spreadsheets for data analysis.

One of the young people who brought the teachings of Ghandi and King to the lunch counters of Nashville in 1960, Lewis suffered taunts and threats, beatings and arrests. He spoke at the historic 1963 March on Washington and became chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The nation, tuned to the nightly news, watched in horror as state troopers clubbed him viciously, fracturing his skull as he led a march in Selma, Alabama, in 1965. Today, he's the only member of Congress who can be proud of having been carried off to jail more than 40 times. With the help of a collaborator, journalist Michael D'Orso, this remarkable man has written a truly remarkable book. <i>Walking with the Wind</i> is a deeply moving personal memoir that skillfully balances the intimate and touching recollections of the deeply thoughtful Lewis with the intense national drama that was the civil rights movement.John Lewis, the Representative for Georgia's 5th Congressional District since 1987, now serves as Chief Deputy Democratic Whip. He lives in Washington, D.C., and Atlanta, Georgia. <p>Michael D'Orso is the author of <i>Like Judgment Day: The Ruin and Redemption of a Town Called Rosewood</i> and lives in Norfolk, Virginia.</p></p><h2>Butcher&#39;s Moon: A Parker Novel</h2><p><p>The sixteenth Parker novel, <i>Butcher&#x2019;s Moon</i> is more than twice as long most of the master heister&#x2019;s adventures, and absolutely jammed with the action, violence, and nerve-jangling tension readers have come to expect. Back in the corrupt town where he lost his money, and nearly his life, in <i>Slayground</i>, Parker assembles a stunning cast of characters from throughout his career for one gigantic, blowout job: starting&#x2014;and finishing&#x2014;a gang war. It feels like the Parker novel to end all Parker novels, and for nearly twenty-five years that&#x2019;s what it was. After its publication in 1974, Donald Westlake said, &#x201c;Richard Stark proved to me that he had a life of his own by simply disappearing. He was gone.&#x201d; <br> <br> Featuring a new introduction by Westlake&#x2019;s close friend and writing partner, Lawrence Block, this classic Parker adventures deserve a place of honor on any crime fan&#x2019;s bookshelf. More than thirty-five years later, <i>Butcher's Moon</i> still packs a punch: keep your calendar clear when you pick it up, because once you open it you won't want to do anything but read until the last shot is fired.</p></p><p><b>Richard Stark</b> was one of the many pseudonyms of Donald E. Westlake (1933&#x2013;2008), a prolific author of crime fiction.

The master thief is back, along with Richard Stark.&#x201d;<br> (Marilyn Stasio <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Westlake knows precisely how to grab a reader, draw him or her into the story, and then slowly tighten his grip until escape is impossible.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Washington Post</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Elmore Leonard wouldn&#x2019;t write what he does if Stark hadn&#x2019;t been there before.

Most books are either too abstract or don't provide enough information that relates to what you actually do when you're out in the busy, wide world about to start a drawing. Where do you start? How do you edit what you see to flatten and shrink it onto your paper? How does perspective work?</p><p><em>The Urban Sketching Handbook: Understanding Perspective</em> helps you learn to think like an architect, to draw buildings and spaces by reducing what you see to simple, basic shapes, then adding layers in simple steps, and finally finishing your sketch with detail, tone, and color--in accurate perspective.

Once you understand perspective, it will change the way you see the world--you'll see perspective everywhere.</p><p>Some of the key concepts explored in this volume are:</p><p>- Basic Terms</p><p>- Basic Spatial Principles</p><p>- Types of Perspective</p><p>- Building a Sketch in Layers</p><p>- Special Conditions</p></p><p><p><b>Stephanie Bower</b>&nbsp;worked as a licensed Architect in New York City before gravitating to professional architectural illustration and concept design.&nbsp;She&nbsp;taught the how-to's of architectural location sketching for over twenty-five years&nbsp;in New York City at Parsons and in Seattle at the University of Washington&nbsp;and Cornish College of the Arts.

What do book designers think about as they turn manuscripts into printed books? In this unique and appealing volume, the award-winning book designer Richard Hendel and eight other talented book designers discuss their approaches and working methods. They consider the problems posed by a wide range of projects&#x2015;selection of a book&#x2019;s size and shape, choice of typeface for text and display, arrangement of type on the page, and determination of typographic details for all parts of the book within manufacturing and budget limitations.<br><br>As omnipresent as books are, few readers are aware of the &#x201c;invisible&#x201d; craft of book designing. The task a book designer faces is different from that faced by other designers. The challenge, says Hendel, isn&#x2019;t to create something different or pretty or clever but to discover how to best serve the author&#x2019;s words. Hendel does not espouse a single philosophy of design or offer a set of instructions; he shows that there are many ways to design a book. In detailed descriptions of the creative process, Hendel and the eight other designers, who represent extensive experience in trade and scholarly publishing in the United States and Great Britain, show how they achieve the most effective visual presentation of words, offering many examples to illustrate their choices. Written not only for seasoned and novice book designers, this book will fascinate others in publishing as well as all readers and authors who are curious to know how books end up looking the way they do.<br></p><p><b>Richard Hendel</b> is associate director and design and production manager at the University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill.<br><br></p><h2>Research in Communication Sciences and Disorders: Methods for Systematic Inquiry, Third Edition</h2><p><i>Research in Communication Sciences and Disorders: Methods for Systematic Inquiry, Third Edition<i>, is a comprehensive yet comprehendible text meant for instructors and students of research methods in the field of communication sciences and disorders.

Features an original map and genealogy chart.</p></p><p><p><b>John McNamara </b>is Professor of English at the University of Houston, where he teaches the early languages and literatures of England, Scotland, and Ireland, with a special focus on their oral traditions. He is the co-editor of <i>Medieval Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Myths, Legends, Tales, Beliefs, and Customs</i>.</p><p><b>From John McNamara&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>Beowulf</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even more perplexing is the question of values and beliefs in the poem. The world of <i>Beowulf</i> is the world of heroic epic, with its legendary fights among larger-than-life figures, both human and monstrous, its scenes of feasting in great beer halls presided over by kings, its accounts of bloody feuds trapping men and women alike in cycles of violence, its praise of giving riches to loyal followers rather than amassing wealth for oneself, its moments of magic in stories of powers gained or lost&#x2014;and over all, a sense of some larger force that shapes their destinies, both individual and collective. Readers have often looked upon this long-gone heroic world for a glimpse of a pagan past in Northern Europe before Christianity was brought by foreign missionaries, yet the poem is filled with references to the new religion and the power of its God. This tension between the ancient past and what was, in the time of the poet, a new worldview disturbed many romantic and nationalistic critics in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They sought in <i>Beowulf</i> the origins of Germanic, including Scandinavian, culture&#x2014;or at least clues from which that culture could be reconstructed. Yet many were for the most part frustrated, for they saw the epic of Northern antiquity &#x201c;marred&#x201d; by the intrusions of foreign beliefs and values, such as the Christianity imposed by missionaries from the Mediterranean South, and equally &#x201c;marred&#x201d; by the fantastic fights with monsters in the center of the poem, while the historical materials that most interested them were placed on the outer edges. In this view, the poem simply was not the poem that it should have been. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, the great work of Friedrich Klaeber, and especially the influence of Tolkien, cited above, would change all that. In recent times, scholars have not only stressed the Christian element as integral to the poem as a whole, but they have spent enormous energy in ferreting out its sources and functions. All of which brings us back, not just to the question of the poet, but more importantly to the question of the audience. After all, the poet was composing the work for a community that already shared certain core values, though those values appear at times to emerge from a moment of cultural transition between the memory of the old and the power of the new. So, once again, we are faced with complexity, and attempts to reduce <i>Beowulf</i> to some single, or at least predominant, worldview cannot explain the creative tensions in this complexity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yet there are further questions about audience. Did it consist, as some scholars have proposed, of people so well versed in Christian teachings, and even in learned theology, that it would have been a monastic community? The answer is by no means clear. We do have the famous letter from Alcuin to the monks of Lindisfarne (797) enjoining them not to include secular heroic narratives in their entertainments. But we also have the even more famous story of the poet Caedmon in Bede&#x2019;s <i>History of the English Church and People</i> (731), which shows the members of the monastery at Whitby singing narrative lays, while accompanying themselves on the harp. Their lays must have been secular since it was only after the miracle of Caedmon&#x2019;s poetic inspiration that Christian biblical narratives were set to traditional Anglo-Saxon poetic forms. Such a community would not only house scholars, as well as monks with considerably less education, but also the monastic familia was made up of all the lay people&#x2014;men, women, and children&#x2014;who occupied and generally worked the lands surrounding (and dependent on) the monastery. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our modern view of medieval monasteries has been shaped by later reforms, in which walled structures often shut reclusive monks in cloistered protection from the temptations of the larger world. But in Anglo-Saxon England, the monasteries were generally open to the social world, and the Rule of St. Benedict lays great stress on the need to extend hospitality to all who come to the community. We also have depictions in monastic works, such as lives of the saints, of storytelling events that included monks and laypeople alike. Thus, even if one were to claim that <i>Beowulf</i> was aimed at a monastic audience, it is clear that such an audience would most probably include many who were not monks. And, of course, one need not postulate a monastic audience at all in order to account for the Christian element in the poem. For the dominant ethos of the poem is a celebration of the values of heroic society, and while the poet-narrator&#x2019;s comments often reflect a Christian point of view, the heroic values in the poem are in themselves primarily secular. Or do we have, once again, a complex creative tension between the two?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></p><h2>Reach C: Student Edition (Reach, Level C)</h2><p>The Student Anthology features paired reading selections with exclusive National Geographic content.

It reviews modulation and detection theory; multiple access techniques, and current wireless standards -- including CDMA, TDMA, AMPS and GSM. It presents case studies of transceiver architectures designed by several leading manufacturers. Finally, it offers detailed explanations of low-noise amplifiers, mixers and oscillators; frequency synthesizers and power amplifiers.<b> </b>For electrical engineers working in the communications fields, especially those involved with wireless technology. Also for graduate students. </p></p><p>Preface<p>The annual worldwide sales of cellular phones has exceeded $2.5B. With 4.5 million customers, home satellite networks comprise a $2.5B industry. The global positioning system is expected to become a $5B market by the year 2000. In Europe, the sales of equipment and services for mobile communications will reach $30B by 1998. The statistics are overwhelming.</p><p>The radio frequency (RF) and wireless market has suddenly expanded to unimaginable dimensions. Devices such as pagers, cellular and cordless phones, cable modems, and RF identification tags are rapidly penetrating all aspects of our lives, evolving from luxury items to indispensable tools. Semiconductor and system companies, small and large, analog and digital, have seen the statistics and are striving to capture their own market share by introducing various RF products. RF design is unique in that it draws upon many disciplines unrelated to integrated circuits (ICs). The RF knowledge base has grown for almost a century, creating a seemingly endless body of literature for the novice.</p><p>This book deals with the analysis and design of RF integrated circuits and systems. Providing a systematic treatment of RF electronics in a tutorial language, the book begins with the necessary background knowledge from microwave and communication theory and leads the reader to the design of RF transceivers and circuits. The text emphasizes both architecture and circuit level issues with respect to monolithic implementation in VLSI technologies.</p><p>The primary focus is on bipolar and CMOS design, but most of the concepts can be applied to other technologies as well. The reader is assumed to have a basic understanding of analog IC design and the theory of signals and systems. The book consists of nine chapters. </p><p>Chapter 1 gives a general introduction, posing questions and providing motivation for subsequent chapters. </p><p>Chapter 2 describes basic concepts in RF and microwave design, emphasizing the effects of nonlinearity and noise. </p><p>Chapters 3 and 4 take the reader to the communication system level, giving an overview of modulation, detection, multiple access techniques, and wireless standards. While initially appearing to be unnecessary, this material is in fact essential to the concurrent design of RF circuits and systems. </p><p>Chapter 5 deals with transceiver architectures, presenting various receiver and transmitter topologies along with their merits and drawbacks. This chapter also includes a number of case studies that exemplify the approaches taken in actual RF products.</p><p>Chapters 6 through 9 address the design of RF building blocks: low-noise amplifiers and mixers, oscillators, frequency synthesizers, and power amplifiers , with particular attention to minimizing the number of off-chip components. An important goal of these chapters is to demonstrate how the system requirements define the parameters of the circuits and how the performance of each circuit impacts that of the overall transceiver.</p><p>I have taught approximately 80% of the material in this book in a 4-unit graduate course at UCLA. Chapters 3, 4, 8, and 9 had to be shortened in a ten-week quarter, but in a semester system they can be covered more thoroughly. Much of my RF design knowledge comes from interactions with colleagues.Helen Kim, Ting-Ping Liu, and Dan Avidor of Bell Laboratories, and David Su and Andrew Gzegorek of Hewlett-Packard Laboratories have contributed to the material in this book in many ways. The text was also reviewed by a number of experts: Stefan Heinen (Siemens), Bart Jansen (Hewlett-Packard), Ting-Ping Liu (Bell Labs), John Long (University of Toronto), Tadao Nak-agawa (NTT), Gitty Nasserbakht (Texas Instruments), Ted Rappaport (Virginia Tech), Tirdad Sowlati (Gennum), Trudy Stetzler (Bell Labs), David Su (Hewlett-Packard), and Rick Wesel (UCLA). In addition, a number of UCLA students, including Farbod Behbahani, Hooman Darabi, John Leete, and Jacob Rael, test drove various chapters and provided useful feedback. I am indebted to all of the above for their kind assistance. I would also like to thank the staff at Prentice Hall, particularly Russ Hall, Maureen Diana, and Kerry Reardon for their support.Behzad RazaviJuly 1997</p></p><h2>Oil &amp; Gas Production in Nontechnical Language</h2><p>This nontechnical treatment is a great introduction to oil and gas production for anyone from beginning petroleum engineering and geology students to accountants, salespersons, and other professionals interested in the industry. Co-authored by Martin Raymond, a veteran production manager, and William Leffler, one of the top petroleum nontechnical writers, it is an easy-to-read reference for those who deal with petroleum industry personnel and production issues in their jobs, but need a quick overview of the technical and business issues. Complete with helpful charts and diagrams, this book covers everything from production equipment and processes to theory, business operations, and strategies.</p><p>Dr. William L. Leffler, a retired executive from Royal Dutch/Shell, spent 36 years with that company. During his career he spent time in refining and marketing, petrochemicals, and corporate planning in the United States, and in exploration and production in London. He earned his MBA and PHD at New York University, and a BS at MIT. He has authored multiple PennWell titles including the bestselling Petroleum Refining in Nontechnical Language, 4th Edition (2008), Petrochemicals in Nontechnical Language, 4th Edition (2010), and Deepwater Petroleum Exploration &amp; Production: A Nontechnical Guide, 2nd Edition (2011). <br> Martin S. Raymond, a veteran of more than 40 years in exploration and production, was senior vice-president - E&amp;P for J.M. Huber Corporation. During his career he also held engineering, administrative, and management positions with Shell Oil and Forest Oil. He earned a BA degree from Princeton in geology and a masters degree from the University of California at Berkeley. Currently, Raymond consults in the area of operating process management for E &amp; P companies. <br>I don't doubt that in those specialized companies and support groups there are many, many people who want to and ought to know more about the processes of producing oil and gas . . . . This book by Leffler and Raymond is a broad leap across the gap between the mysteries of production operations and the need for better understanding by those who help make it happen.<br> (John F.

This definitive guide, written by the designer of C++, now provides coverage of all of the features available in the most recent release, including multiple inheritance, typesafe linkage, and abstract classes. Includes two new chapters on how to design C++ programs.</p><p>This classic work shows a care and understanding of C++ that only Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer of the language, can achieve. It also conveys the punctilious and sometimes suffocating detail that only Stroustrup would desire to communicate. The novice programmer will have difficulty distinguishing between the essential and the dispensable material. However, experienced C++ programmers will appreciate the reference manual portion of the book, which contains an exact definition of C++ that even numerous examples cannot express. Stroustrup&#39;s book has several chapters on classes and the reference manual component of the book contains the complete grammar of classes. This is a book that every experienced C++ programmer needs to own."The road goes ever on and on".<p>----Bilbo Baggins</p><p> As promised in the first edition of the book, C++ has been evolving to meet the needs of its users. This evolution has been guided by the experience of users of widely varying backgrounds working in a great range of application areas. The C++ user community has grown a hundredfold during the six years since the first edition of this book; many lessons have been learned, and many techniques have been discovered and/or validated by experience. Some of these experiences are reflected here.</p><p> The primary aim of the language extensions made in the last six years has been to enhance C++ as a language for data abstraction and object-oriented programming in general and to enhance it as a tool for writing high-quality libraries of user-defined types in particular. A "high-quality library," is a library that provides a concept to a user in the form of one or more classes that are convenient, safe, and efficient to use. In this context, safe means that a class provides a specific, type-safe interface between the users of the library and its providers; efficient means that use of the class does not impose significant overheads in run-time or space on the user compared with handwritten C code.</p><p> This book presents the complete C++ language. Chapters 1 through 10 give a tutorial introduction; Chapters 11 through 13 provide a discussion of design and software development issues; and, finally, the complete C++ reference manual is included. Naturally, the features added and resolutions made since the original edition are integral parts of the presentation. They include refined overloading resolution, memory management facilities, and access control mechanisms, type-safe linkage, const and static member functions, abstract classes, multiple inheritance, templates, and exception handling.</p><p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language; its core application domain is systems programming in the broadest sense. In addition, C++ is successfully used in many application areas that are not covered by this label. Implementations of C++ exist from some of the most modest microcomputers to the largest supercomputers and for almost all operating systems. Consequently, this book describes the C++ langauge itself without trying to explain a particular implementation, programming environment, or library.</p><p>This book presents many examples of classes that, although useful, should be classified as "toys." This style of exposition allows general principles and useful techniques to stand out more clearly than they would in a fully elaborated program, where they would be buried in details. Most of the useful classes presented here, such as linked lists, arrays, character strings, matrices, graphics classes, associative arrays, etc., are available in "bulletproof" and/or "goldplated" versions from a wide variety of commercial and non-commercial sources. Many of these "industrial strength" classes and libraries are actually direct and indirect descendants of the toy versions found here.</p><p>This edition provides a greater emphasis on tutorial aspects than did the first edition of this book. However, the presentation is still aimed squarely at experienced programmers and endeavors not to insult their intelligence or experience. The discussion of design issues has been greatly expanded to reflect the demand for information beyond the description of language features and their immediate use. Technical detail and precision have also been increased. The reference manual, in particular, represents many years of work in this direction. The intent has been to provide a book with a depth sufficient to make more than one reading rewarding to most programmers. In other words, this book presents the C++ language, its fundamental principles, and the key techniques needed to apply it. Enjoy!</p><p>Acknowledgments</p><p>In addition to the people mentioned in the acknowledgments section in the preface to the first edition, I would like to thank Al Aho, Steve Buroff, Jim Coplien, Ted Goldstein, Tony Hansen, Peter Juhl, Brian Kernighan, Andrew Koenig, Bill Leggett, Warren Montgomery, Mike Mowbray, Rob Murray, Jonathan Shopiro, Mike Vilot, and Peter Weinberger for commenting on draft chapters of this second edition. Many people influenced the development of C++ from 1985 to 1991. I can mention only a few: Andrew Koenig, Brian Kernighan, Doug McIlroy, and Jonathan Shopiro. Also thanks to the many participants of the "external reviews" and the reference manual drafts and to the people who suffered through the first year of X3J16.

A Canadian writer (Addiction to Perfection) and Jungian analyst, Woodman is also known for her New Age feminism and frequent appearances with poet Robert Bly, with whom she coauthored The Maiden King. Reproduced here is the journal she kept from November 1993 to March 1995 that documents the internal spiritual struggle her illness triggered. She details how she used imagery, took herbs and supplements prescribed by nontraditional healers and, in addition, followed their dietary strictures in order to fortify her body to withstand the recommended radiation treatment (including a painful and harrowing 48-hour ordeal). Woodman's diary entries are filled with introspective ruminations, mythological allusions, references to Jungian archetypes and the divisions between the masculine and the feminine, which will have the greatest appeal to those who are familiar with her work. Although Woodman had the support of her husband and friends during her illness, she was haunted by the recent death of a brother from cancer, her osteoporosis worsened and she was also later threatened by a new tumor that proved to be benign. Woodman has recovered from her cancer; those who have been similarly afflicted will appreciate her courage and determination to reclaim her body and spirit. 8-city author tour.

Related to intention is the concept of mindfulness - the awareness that arises through intentionally attending to oneself and others in an open, caring, and nonjudgmental way. Authors Shapiro and Carlson draw from Eastern wisdom and practices as well as Western psychological theory and science to explore why mindful awareness is integral to the therapeutic healing process and to show clinicians how to connect with this deeper awareness. This second edition is an accessible discussion of the fundamentals and also contains new sections describing the latest research on the neuroscience of mindfulness and mechanisms of change. Integrating the art and science of mindfulness to inspire greater well-being in both clinicians and their patients, this volume bridges a gap between therapist and patient, reminding us that we are all human beings wanting health, happiness, and freedom from suffering.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Psychotherapies are a century young, meditative disciplines millennia old. As therapists we have much to learn from these venerable disciplines, and this book offers a fine introduction to both recent applications and research.<b>Shauna L.

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented scripting language. Python is growing in popularity because:</p><ul><li>It is available on all important platforms: Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows 98, Linux, all major UNIX platforms, MacOS, and even the BeOS.</li><li>It is open-source software, copyrighted but freely available for use, even in commercial applications.</li><li>Its clean object-oriented interface makes it a valuable prototyping tool for C++ programmers.</li><li>It works well with all popular windowing toolkits, including MFC, Tk, Mac, X11, and Motif.<i>Learning Python</i> is written by Mark Lutz, author of<i>Programming Python</i> and <i>Python Pocket Reference</i>; and David Ascher, a vision scientist and Python user.This book starts with a thorough introduction to the elements of Python: types, operators, statements, classes, functions, modules, and exceptions. By reading the first part of the book, the reader will be able to understand and construct programs in the Python language. In the second part of the book, the authors present more advanced information, demonstrating how Python performs common tasks and presenting real applications and the libraries available for those applications.All the examples use the Python interpreter, so the reader can type them in and get instant feedback. Each chapter ends with a series of exercises. Solutions to the exercises are in an appendix.</li></ul></p><p>The authors of <i>Learning Python</i> show you enough essentials of the Python scripting language to enable you to begin solving problems right away, then reveal more powerful aspects of the language one at a time. This approach is sure to appeal to programmers and system administrators who have urgent problems and a preference for learning by semi-guided experimentation.<p> First off, <i>Learning Python</i> shows the relationships among Python scripts and their interpreter (in a mostly platform-neutral way). Then, the authors address the mechanics of the language itself, providing illustrations of how Python conceives of numbers, strings, and other objects as well as the operators you use to work with them. Dictionaries, lists, tuples, and other data structures specific to Python receive plenty of attention including complete examples.</p><p> Authors Mark Lutz and David Ascher build on that fundamental information in their discussions of functions and modules, which evolve into coverage of namespaces, classes, and the object-oriented aspects of Python programming. There's also information on creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Python applications with Tkinter.</p><p> In addition to its careful expository prose, <i>Learning Python</i> includes exercises that both test your Python skills and help reveal more elusive truths about the language.</p><p>Mark Lutz is an independent Python trainer, writer, and software developer, and is one of the primary figures in the Python community. He is the author of the O'Reilly books Programming Python and Python Pocket Reference (both in 2nd Editions), and co-author of Learning Python (both in 2nd Editions). Mark has been involved with Python since 1992, began teaching Python classes in 1997, and has instructed over 90 Python training sessions as of early 2003. In addition, he holds BS and MS degrees in computer science from the University of Wisconsin, and over the last two decades has worked on compilers, programming tools, scripting applications, and assorted client/server systems. Whenever Mark gets a break from spreading the Python word, he leads an ordinary, average life with his kids in Colorado. Mark can be reached by email at , or on the web at http://www.rmi.net/~lutz.</p><p>David Ascher is the lead for Python projects at ActiveState, including Komodo, ActiveState's integrated development environment written mostly in Python. David has taught courses about Python to corporations, in universities, and at conferences. He also organized the Python track at the 1999 and 2000 O'Reilly Open Source Conventions, and was the program chair for the 10th International Python Conference. In addition, he co-wrote Learning Python (both editions) and serves as a director of the Python Software Foundation.

How do you know? Are you developing your leadership effectiveness at the pace of change?</b></p> <p>For most leaders today, complexity is outpacing their personal and collective development. Most leaders are <i>in over their heads</i>, whether they know it or not. The most successful organizations over time are the best led.&nbsp; While this has always been true, today escalating global complexity puts leadership effectiveness at a premium.&nbsp;<i>Mastering Leadership</i>&nbsp;involves developing the effectiveness of leaders&#x2015;individually and collectively&#x2015;and turning that leadership into a competitive advantage. This comprehensive roadmap for optimal leadership features:</p> <ul> <li>Breakthrough research that connects increased leadership effectiveness with enhanced business performance</li> <li>The first fully integrated Universal Model of Leadership&#x2015;one that integrates the best theory and research in the fields of Leadership and Organizational Development over the last half century</li> <li>A free, online self-assessment of your leadership, using the Leadership Circle Profile, visibly outlining how you are currently leading and how to develop even greater effectiveness</li> <li>The five stages in the evolution of leadership&#x2015;Egocentric, Reactive, Creative, Integral, and Unitive&#x2015;along with the organizational structures and cultures that develop at each of these stages</li> <li>Six leadership practices for evolving your leadership capability at a faster pace</li> <li>A map of your optimal path to greater leadership effectiveness</li> <li>Case stories that facilitate pragmatic application of this Leadership Development System to your particular situation</li> </ul> <p>This timeless, authoritative text provides a systemic approach for developing your senior leaders and the leadership system of your organization. It does not recommend quick fixes, but argues that real development requires a strategic, long-term, and integrated approach in order to forge more effective leaders and enhanced business performance.&nbsp;<i>Mastering Leadership</i>&nbsp;offers a developmental pathway to bring forth the highest and best use of yourself, your life, and your leadership.&nbsp; By more meaningfully deploying all of who you are every day, individually and collectively, you will achieve a leadership legacy consistent with your highest aspirations.</p></p><p><p>We wrote this book because, after a combined 60 years' of working with leaders on their development, we know there is a far better way to go about it. The current "state-of-the-art" of the Leadership Development field is not up to the task of developing leaders for the complex challenges we are facing now, let alone for the future. </p><p>We need leaders of greater effectiveness and integrity, mastery and maturity, courage and compassion, competence and character, consciousness and wisdom. We need those leaders now. Not only is complexity outpacing the development of effective and consciously competent leaders, but the world is facing a leadership crisis. Our collective welfare, organizationally and globally, depends on our ability to develop leaders that are up to the challenge of creating a thriving future for everyone. </p><p>Most of our approaches to developing leaders are inadequate. They are episodic, not systemic; individually focused, instead of individually and collectively focused; they are too often superficial, lacking the depth required for genuine breakthrough; and they are generally sponsored, not led, by top leadership. Add to this, that the field of Leadership Development is a random collection of unintegrated theory and research. As long as we continue to approach the development of leadership this way we will continue to fall short. We wrote this book to document how we have changed this and to raise the bar on how to develop great leadership. </p><p>In one compelling read, <i>Mastering Leadership</i> integrates the best theory, research and practice into the first Universal Model of Leadership to arise in the field. It radically shifts the understanding of extraordinary leadership and how to champion its development. It thoroughly describes the sequential stages of leadership mastery and maturity. It outlines six powerful practices that will reliably evolve your leadership, individually and collectively. As we unfold the Universal Model, chapter-by-chapter, we provide research that links all of this to measures of leadership effectiveness and business performance; metrics to assess your progress; and case studies to guide your own transformational success story. Research and case studies demonstrate the transformative capability of the Universal Model and demonstrate how to implement a systemic approach to the development of leaders and the Leadership System of your organization. </p><p>We wrote this book for all of us. For most of us in leadership, complexity is outpacing our rate of development. We are in over our heads whether we know it or not. We invite you to accelerate the development of your leadership effectiveness by taking <i>The Leadership Circle Profile Self-Assessment</i> that comes with this book. The assessment, which measures leadership effectiveness through the lens of the Universal Model, in combination with this book, is a complete leadership development system. Together, they take you on a deep dive into the terrain of transformation, yours and your organization's. </p><p>We need better leaders at all levels--men and women who create thriving futures, healthy cultures <i>and</i> competitive companies; who balance short-term profitability with long-term sustainability; who create a better world. Mastering leadership is now a strategic priority, a competitive advantage and a global imperative. By committing to this imperative you can: </p><ul> <li>Develop through each stage in the journey of mastering leadership.</li> <li>Turn your leadership capabilities into a distinct competitive advantage.</li> <li>Cultivate leaders in your organization with a proven leadership development system.</li> <li>Infuse every business conversation with leadership guidance.</li> <li>And much more...</li> </ul> <p><i>Mastering Leadership</i> is a complete system for developing yourself, your team and your organization's Leadership System to maximize performance. It is our sincere hope that this book will support your leadership for life.</p><p>Praise for<i> Mastering</i> LEADERSHIP </p><p>"This is the definitive book on leadership principles and practices! Expansive and practical at the same time, <i>Mastering Leadership</i> is for forward-thinking leaders who want the most essential leadership lessons analyzed and presented in one astute place. Anderson and Adams' Universal Model synthesizes everything that leadership theory thus far has to offer.

However, in their new book, <i>Mastering Leadership</i>, Adams and Anderson turn theory into practice by framing great leadership as a purposeful pursuit rather than a genetic anomaly. Their leadership model provides a well proven framework that allows leaders to assess their strengths and needs. Importantly, it also provides the practical knowledge and tools to enable a transition to greater effectiveness. This book should be a well-worn staple in every leader's '10 Essentials."<br> <b>&#x2015;John Mendel, </b>Executive Vice President, Automotive, American Honda </p><p>"This is not a book written for bedtime reading. Its ideas need to be examined in the bright light of day and then...for the courageous...put into practice. The authors have very skillfully woven a tapestry with threads from extensive research, years of experience, philosophy, and metaphysics. The Leadership Circle Profile (LCP) and the Universal Model of Leadership (UML) are tools that empirically guide the reader on a journey of self-discovery and growth. Their application breeches the barriers of traditional thinking and carries the reader into the realm of Unity Leadership. The demands on today's leaders to produce high-performing and highly-productive organizations has never been greater. Therefore, understanding the correlation between business performance and leadership effectiveness has never been more important.

It gives form and proof that leadership is a human function. You can define it, measure it, teach it, and yet, in the end, our capacity to be honest with ourselves and fulfill our promises to each other is decisive.

The island's beauty, its proximity and easy travel access to New York, and its suitability for yachting and other recreational pursuits made it the perfect place for the leisure class.

Its founders and early sponsors--Rousseau, Herder, Fichte, Korais, and Mazzini--looked to nationalism as the manifestation of modern humanity's most essential aspirations: autonomy, unity, identity. Born of notions regarding popular freedom and sovereignty that had been gathering momentum for generations, it conjured up images of a modernizing West at once hungry for change and yearning for a return to age-old concepts of fraternity and ancient heritage. Since that time nationalism, having taken on countless different dimensions, remains a vital and dynamic force for change--whether for good or otherwise.<br>Despite only recently becoming the subject of scholarly debate, nationalism has been the focus of a truly prodigious amount of writing. This important Oxford Reader makes the topic more accessible by offering a broad, authoritative treatment of the key contributions to the subject, while giving unprecedented depth to recent debates and issues. Edited by two of the field's most influential scholars, the readings are representative of the vast array of experience and scholarship that have shaped the concept of nationalism for over two centuries. From Ernest Renan's What is a Nation?, written in the 1880s, to the more current views of the 1990s, <em>Nationalism</em> gathers under one cover an impressive array of writing on everything from imagined communities to ethno-regional movements. In no other volume will students of politics, history, sociology, anthropology, international relations, and cultural studies have access to such a definitive appraisal of one of the modern world's most influential--and explosive--ideas.<br></p><p>For the last two centuries, nationalism has been a central feature of society and politics. Few ideologies can match its power and resonance and no other symbolic language has such worldwide appeal and resilience. However, nationalism is more than an ideological movement &#x2013; it is also a form of public culture which draws on much older cultural and symbolic forms.<br> <p>This book provides a concise, accessible introduction to the concept of nationalism. It focuses on competing paradigms and theories of nations and nationalism, and analyses the subject in terms of ideology, theory and history.<br> </p> <p>The approach is broadly comparative and interdisciplinary, with concrete examples and a time-scale stretching from the ancient world to the contemporary global age. The book concludes with an assessment of the prospects of nationalism and of the transcendence of nations and nation states.<br> </p> <p>Anthony Smith's book will appeal to all those interested in this dynamic subject, including students and scholars of anthropology, sociology, history, politics and international relations.</p><br>Anthony Smith is Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics.

Roosevelt, running for an unprecedented third term, and talented Republican businessman Wendell Willkie&#x2014;found themselves on the defensive against American isolationists and their charismatic spokesman Charles Lindbergh, who called for surrender to Hitler's demands. In this dramatic account of that turbulent and consequential election, historian Susan Dunn brings to life the debates, the high-powered players, and the dawning awareness of the Nazi threat as the presidential candidates engaged in their own battle for supremacy.&nbsp;<i>1940 </i>not only explores the contest between FDR and Willkie but also examines the key preparations for war that went forward, even in the midst of that divisive election season. The book tells an inspiring story of the triumph of American democracy in a world reeling from fascist barbarism, and it offers a compelling alternative scenario to today&#x2019;s hyperpartisan political arena, where common ground seems unattainable.</p><p>This spellbinding story of the Roosevelt-Willkie election season explores the deep divisions in the United States on the eve of World War II, the pull of Lindbergh&#39;s staunch isolationism, and the courageous candidates and politicians who forged crucial agreements across the aisle.<b>Susan Dunn</b> is the Third Century Professor of Humanities at Williams College.

Smil argues that no advanced economy can prosper without a strong, innovative manufacturing sector and the jobs it creates. </p><p>Smil explains how manufacturing became a fundamental force behind America's economic, strategic, and social dominance. He describes American manufacturing's rapid rise at the end of the nineteenth century, its consolidation and modernization between the two world wars, its role as an enabler of mass consumption after 1945, and its recent decline. Some economists argue that shipping low-value jobs overseas matters little because the high-value work remains in the United States. But, asks Smil, do we want a society that consists of a small population of workers doing high-value-added work and masses of unemployed? </p><p>Smil assesses various suggestions for solving America's manufacturing crisis, including lowering corporate tax rates, promoting research and development, and improving public education. Will America act to preserve and reinvigorate its manufacturing? It is crucial to our social and economic well-being; but, Smil warns, the odds are no better than even. </p></p><p>Vaclav Smil is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Manitoba.

It&#x2019;s the story of Adriana, a simple girl with no fortune but her beauty who models naked for a painter, accepts gifts from men, and could never quite identify the moment when she traded her private dream of home and children for the life of a prostitute.<br> One of the very few novels of the twentieth century which can be ranked with the work of Dostoevsky, <i>The Woman of Rome</i> also tells the stories of the tortured university student Giacomo, a failed revolutionary who refuses to admit his love for Adriana; of the sinister figure of Astarita, the Secret Police officer obsessed with Adriana; and of the coarse and brutal criminal Sonzogno, who treats Adriana as his private property. Within this story of passion and betrayal, Moravia calmly strips away the pride and arrogance hiding the corrupt heart of Italian Fascism.</p><p>Alberto Moravia was born in Rome in 1907 and published his first novel at 21. In the 1930s, censored by Mussolini and the Vatican alike, Moravia resorted to writing under a pseudonym.

The menus and recipes offered here include fruits, vegetables, proteins and various carbohydrates. Pounds reportedly come off quickly, safely and in large quantities in a six-phase regimen low in protein, cholesterol and sodium, and high in fiber. According to Moscovitz, more than 20,000 people have been treated by Walter Kempner, M.D., of Duke University since he developed the diet over 40 years ago, and many have kept the weight off. The bad news is that the rigid diet must be followed exactly, allows virtually no salt or spices, and prescribes a paltry calorie intake. The author hastransferred her fanaticism from food to the Rice Diet: "Mosco-Fats" was "a 275-pound ugly mound of flesh" who sold her worldly possessions for a stay at Kempner's clinic.

He went on to create the award-winning American Photographer magazine which he edited for 10 years before moving into new media, currently as VP, Executive Producer of Time Warner Cable&#39;s high speed online information service, Road Runner. Over the years he has continued his interest in photography as an editor or author of ten books on the medium.Margaret Bourke-White and Lewis W. Hine were both imaginative, disciplined, and successful photographers in an era when the medium was finely positioned as an art form. Both these volumes also give visual evidence of their recording of time and place through personal courage. Bourke-White is famous for her daring vantage points, confirmed by the shot of her perched on one of the aluminum eagles high atop the Chrysler Building in New York as she photographed its streamlined details. Hine likewise positioned himself and his camera above New York as the Empire State Building was bolted together. The collection of Bourke-White's work is well produced, with deep tones and fine clarity, reminding those who admire her great gifts of composition and darkroom skill of her significance in the history of photography. Newcomers to her travels and her work will quickly discover a photojournalist and industrial artist whose professional journey left a stunning record of the century. Still fresh and visually exciting after 70 years, Hine's images capture the glory of the Empire State Building and the aerial gymnastics of the steelworkers who built its skeleton. Though focusing on one building may seem confining, Hine's array of photographs from steel framing to completion; Freddy Langer's essay about the photographer, the skyscraper, and New York in the 1930s; and a chronology of the Empire State Building's "life" in the city make for a useful and pleasing volume.

Original.</p><p>John Coston is a veteran journalist and a former news editor on the national desk at the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. He has written for the <i>Watertown Daily Times</i>, the <i>Hartford Courant</i>, and the <i>Miami Herald</i>. Coston is the author of two true crime books, <i>To Kill and Kill Again</i> and <i>Sleep, My Child, Forever</i>.<br> &nbsp;Coston, a news editor at the Wall Street Journal , has reconstructed the rampage of Wayne Nance, a Montana psychopath who in daily life appeared polite and generous but who committed at least four brutal sexual murders over 12 years. Police did not thoroughly pursue Nance, who was a neighbor of the first victim and placed by witnesses near the murder scene. He certainly gave cause for concern: in childhood he had displayed a sadistic streak; he collected knives and swords and had branded a pentagram on his arm. After a troubled stint in the Navy, Nance returned home to a job in a furniture warehouse, which gave him entree into many homes and the opportunity for deadly deeds. Coston's story proceeds to a suspenseful climax in which Nance finally meets victims who fight back and kill him. Though the narrative sometimes seems choppy with flashbacks and background on victims, Coston effectively conjures up the tense atmosphere of small-town Missoula. He theorizes superficially about Nance's dysfunctional family and the nature of serial killers, but his lack of psychological insight doesn't get in the way of a good tale.

There is no answer except: Helen Garner is a great writer; <i>The Spare Room</i> is a great book.' Peter Carey<br><br>'Cleanly-written, sharp, with the authority of lived experience but an artist's penetration of the issues. It provides a portrait very hard to erase, of a child's ego trapped in a failing and ageing body, and it raises uncomfortable questions: what are the limits of friendship?

A society utterly wrecked by a hurricane of violence.&nbsp;<br> <br> In this compelling book, the renowned historian Karl Schl�gel reconstructs with meticulous care the process through which, month by month, the terrorism of a state-of-emergency regime spiraled into the &#x2018;Great Terror&#x2019; during which 1 � million human beings lost their lives within a single year. He revisits the sites of show trials and executions and, by also consulting numerous sources from the time, he provides a masterful panorama of these key events in Russian history.<br> <br> He shows how, in the shadow of the reign of terror, the regime around Stalin also aimed to construct a new society. Based on countless documents, Schl�gel&#x2019;s historical masterpiece vividly presents an age in which the boundaries separating the dream and the terror dissolve, and enables us to experience the fear that was felt by people subjected to totalitarian rule. This rich and absorbing account of the Soviet purges will be essential reading for all students of Russia and for any readers interested in one of the most dramatic and disturbing events of modern history.</p><p>Karl Schl�gel is Professor of Eastern European History at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt.<b>Winner of the Leipzig Book Prize for European Understanding<br> <br> </b>"An almost impossibly rich masterpiece.

Schl�gel is an unusually inventive historian and a brilliant stylist; it&#x2019;s a great boon to have his latest work available in English.<b>"<br> Norman M. Naimark, Stanford University and author of <i>Stalin&#x2019;s Genocides</i></b> <p>"This book&#x2019;s focus is one year, 1937, and one place, Moscow, but it is no narrow history. The narrative has sweep and depth, encompassing the mundane, the spectacular, and the nightmare dream world of Stalin&#x2019;s purges; an incomparable book about people during one of the most grandiose and terrifying epochs of the twentieth century."<br> <b>David Shearer, University of Delaware</b></p> <p>"Starting from a birds-eye view of the city from above, a homage to the flight of Bulgakov&#x2019;s Margarita, Schloegel captures the complex specificity of a time and place of immense significance in Soviet and twentieth-century history. In this multivalent historical moment, interrogations at the Lubyanka coexist with happy summer vacations and the triumphant conquest of the North Pole by Soviet aviators.&nbsp; Schloegel brings into play an ingenious variety of sources, ranging from architectural blueprints and city directories to execution records, not forgetting diaries and literary evocations. This is a masterful, panoramic work by a gifted story-teller who is also a highly innovative, sophisticated and erudite historian."<br> <b>Sheila Fitzpatrick, University of Chicago</b></p> <p>"In brilliant fashion Karl Schl�gel presents Moscow as a rotating stage of Soviet desire and Stalinist nightmares. Like no other author before him, he charges his prose and the sequence of scenes with the hallucinatory power of the Communist project. The vertiginous and terrifying effect is his very point and singular achievement."<br> <b>Jochen Hellbeck, Rutgers University</b></p> <p>"Karl Schlogel's Moscow 1937 is a brilliant essay of "Total history" on&nbsp; a crucial episode of Soviet history, on one of the greatest historical catastrophes of the Twentieth Century.This is the first book which goes beyond totalitarianism and revisionism and&nbsp; brings us a totally new interpretation of this tragic&nbsp; event&nbsp; by&nbsp; presenting together&nbsp; opposing experiences and manifestations such as the preparation for universal, free, direct and secret elections and carefully planned, organized mass killings. Or, in other words, Dream and Terror."<br> <b>Nicolas Werth, Institut d&#x2019;histoire du temps pr�sent<br> <br> </b></p> <p>"This is a montage of a great city in tumult, in equal parts depicting the optimism of progress and the horror of the show trials, all in the shadow of a looming war."<br> <b>Andrew Cornish, <i>Readings<br> <br> </i></b>"While most historians see both terror and civilisation as important to understanding the Soviet experience of the 1930s, they tend to spend their time investigating either one or the other.

They are expecting an orphan boy to help with the work at Green Gables - but a skinny red-haired girl turns up instead. Highly spirited Anne Shirley charms her way into the Cuthberts' affection with her vivid imagination and constant chatter, and soon it's impossible to imagine life without her. A favourite classic with cover and introduction by the inimitable Lauren Child, award-winning creator of Clarice Bean and the hugely popular Charlie and Lola series.</p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history.

Here are all of his extant woodcuts, a collection of over 300 great works containing all the familiar cuts long treasured by the world's art lovers: the celebrated series on the Life of the Virgin, The Apocalypse of John (17 cuts), The Great Passion, St. Jerome in his Study, Samson Fighting the Lion, The Fall of Icarus, The Six Knots, The Men's Bath, St. Christopher, The Virgin in Glory, The Rhinoceros, The Last Supper of 1523, illustrations from D�rer's "The Art of Measurement" and from his four books on human proportion, and many others, including much little-known material. This book is the only available source for many of these works.<br>Although sacred subjects predominate (the Holy Family, scenes from Christ's life, crucifixion, etc., the lives of the saints, Old Testament episodes), many other motifs are treated. There are portraits of prominent men of the ages, book illustrations (secular and religious), coats of arms, the celestial and terrestrial globes, animals, mythological and historical themes, etc. The plates are arranged generally in chronological order permitting the reader to view the development of D�rer's art. From out of the gnarled figures and landscapes one can see the emergence of an individualistic style and skill unrivaled in this sphere.<br>An introduction by Campbell Dodgson and a 34-page textual guide to the plates by Dr. Willi Kurth discuss the evidence and controversies surrounding the authenticity of each work, citing the opinions of all the important D�rer scholars; they also furnish the reader with the historical background of the cuts and of D�rer's life and times &#x2014; from the years of apprenticeship in Nuremberg to the last works of 1520&#x2013;1528.<br>All of the woodcuts are reproduced in excellent detail.

Heart-centered metaphysicians ask: What is the nature of God; What is the nature of humankind?; and What is the relationship between God and humankind? Their exploration is aimed at discerning the fundamental Truths, or Divine Ideas, that ring true for every human being, regardless of time, place and circumstance. As you expand your understanding of these principles, you will begin to experience the world differently, ultimately creating change in your outer life and circumstances. Through the understanding and compassionate application of heart-centered metaphysics, you can raise your own consciousness and at the same time contribute to an elevated consciousness in the world. This new level of awareness is our best tool for creating loving, fulfilling lives in a peaceful world. Open your heart and mind to Divine Ideas in this thought-provoking study guide. Each chapter features Summary Statements, Topics for Discussion, Thoughts for Reflection and Meditation and Suggestions for Supplementary Reading</p><p>Rev.

His wife Sybilla is a glittering actress, unforgiving of Bruce&#39;s failure, and the couple lead separate lives in their house at Regent&#39;s Park. When Bruce is called away on a sudden trip to Paris, he vanishes completely - until his suitcase and passport are found in a sinister artist&#39;s studio, the Belfry, in a crumbling house in Notting Hill. Inspector Macdonald must uncover Bruce&#39;s secrets, and find out the identity of his mysterious blackmailer. This intricate mystery from a classic writer is set in a superbly evoked London of the 1930s.</p><p>E. C. R.

Her books have been almost entirely neglected since her death, but deserve rediscovery as fine examples of classic British crime fiction in its golden age."The intricacies of the characters' relationships and the trove of secrets Scotland Yard Inspector Macdonald uncovers make for riveting reading." (Connie Fletcher <i><b><i>Booklist</i></b></i>)<br><br>"The mystery is so complex, in fact, that Lorac, the pseudonym of Edith Caroline Rivett (1894-1958), requires the services of some aggressively facetious suspects, a low-key lead detective who's a welcome change of pace, and an army of nondescript and interchangeable satellite police officers.

His history of Berlin's architectural successes and failures reads entertainingly like a detective novel."&#x2014;Peter Schneider, <i>New Republic</i><br><br>"[Ladd's] well-written and well-illustrated book amounts to a brief history of the city as well as a guide to its landscape."&#x2014;Anthony Grafton, <i>New York Review of Books</i>&nbsp;</p><p>Berlin is once again the official capital of a united Germany and, perhaps, the metaphorical capital of a new Europe. In accordance with its received status, a series of massive architectural projects has been initiated, intended to restore, reveal, and reinvent both the physical and the symbolic city of Berlin. But to build a future, one must first examine the past. And Berlin&#39;s past is particularly troubling. In this elegant and compelling work, Brian Ladd examines the ongoing conflicts radiating from the remarkable fusion of architecture, history, and national identity in Berlin. How is reunified Germany confronting a divisive and authoritarian past rendered tangible by the Berlin Wall, the Reichstag, Hitler&#39;s bunker - even the Brandenburg Gate? How can the rich culture of the past, the artistic and intellectual heritage of Berlin&#39;s avant garde, be rescued from the Cold War blight of Potsdamer Platz? And can the Neue Wache, Berlin&#39;s monumental remembrance of the horrors of tyranny and war, become the structural centerpiece and the symbolic guardian of this once and future capital? With keen insight and exacting scholarship, Ladd surveys the urban landscape, excavating its ruins, contemplating its buildings and memorials, and carefully deconstructing the public debates and political controversies emerging from its past. In the end, it becomes clear that the ghosts of Berlin may never, indeed should never, fade away.<b>Brian Ladd</b>&nbsp;is an urban historian and research associate at the University at Albany, State University of New York.</p><h2>Teaching and Learning with Technology, Loose-Leaf Version (6th Edition)</h2><p><p> <i>For courses in Technology in Education / Instructional Media and Technology.</i> </p> <p> </p> <p> <b>Note: This is the loose-leaf version of</b>&nbsp;<b> <i>Teaching and Learning with Technology&nbsp;</i>and does not include access Revel&#x2122;.

Among the distinguished readers are Christopher Lee, Derek Jacobi, Simon Callow, Linus Roache, Elizabeth McGovern, Terry Jones, Peter Firth, and Rufus Sewell. Each package of cassettes in the Audio Classics series is beautifully packaged and shrink-wrapped.</p><p>A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul. The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms. It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction. The series will be extensive and open-ended and will provide school students with a range of edited texts taken from a wide geographical spread.</p><h2>American Horizons: U.S. History in a Global Context, Volume II: Since 1865, with Sources</h2><p><em>American Horizons</em>, Second Edition, is the only U.S. History survey text that presents the traditional narrative in a global context. The authors use the frequent movement of people, goods, and ideas into, out of, and within America's borders as a framework. This unique approach provides a fully integrated global perspective that seamlessly contextualizes American events within the wider world. The authors, all acclaimed scholars in their specialties, use their individual strengths to provide students with a balanced and inclusive account of U.S. history.<br><br>Presented in two volumes for maximum flexibility, <em>American Horizons</em>, Second Edition, illustrates the relevance of U.S. history to American students by centering on the matrix of issues that dominate their lives. These touchstone themes include population movements and growth, the evolving definition of citizenship, cultural change and continuity, people's relationship to and impact upon the environment, political and ideological contests and their consequences, and Americans' five centuries of engagement with regional, national, and global institutions, forces, and events. In addition, this beautifully designed, full-color book features hundreds of photos and images and more than 100 maps.</p><p><br><strong>Michael Schaller</strong>, University of Arizona<br><strong>Robert Schulzinger</strong>, University of Colorado Boulder<br><strong>John Bez�s-Selfa</strong>, Wheaton College<br><strong>Janette Thomas Greenwood</strong>, Clark University<br><strong>Andrew Kirk</strong>, University of Nevada Las Vegas<br><strong>Sarah J.

Each essay is written by an experienced teacher/scholar and describes one of the major pedagogies employed today: process, expressive, rhetorical, collaborative, feminist, critical, cultural studies, community service, and basic writing. Writing centers, writing across the curriculum, and technology and the teaching of writing are also discussed. The essays are composed of personal statements on pedagogical applications and bibliographical guides that aid students and new teachers in further study and research.

As the bodies pile up, Elizabeth Bennet grows from a naive young teenager into a savage slayer of the undead. Along the way, two men vie for her affections: Master Hawksworth is the powerful warrior who trains her to kill, while thoughtful Dr. Keckilpenny seeks to conquer the walking dead using science instead of strength. Will either man win the prize of Elizabeth&#x2019;s heart? Or will their hearts be feasted upon by hordes of marauding zombies?</p><p><b>Steve Hockensmith</b> is an award-winning novelist and reporter. His debut mystery, <i>Holmes on the Range</i>, was a finalist for the Edgar, Shamus, and Anthony awards. Critics have hailed the novel and its sequels as "hilarious" (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>), "dazzling" (<i>The Boston Globe</i>), "clever" (<i>The New York Times</i>), "uproarious" (<i>Publisher's Weekly</i>), "wonderfully entertaining" (Booklist), and "quirky and original" (<i>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i>). He lives in Alameda, California, with his wife and two children.Edgar winner Hockensmith turns to zombie lit in this prequel to Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (2009). Ever wondered how the Bennett sisters got to be such great zombie killers? Hockensmith explains all in the story of the return of the zombie plague and Mr. Bennett&#x2019;s secret history. When a neighbor rises up out of his coffin in the middle of a funeral, Mr. Bennett shrugs off the lifestyle of a Regency England gentleman and returns to his old calling as a warrior dedicated to eradicating the Unentionables. Turning the greenhouse into a dojo, he trains all five Bennett girls, with the help of fellow warrior Master Hawksworth, to take up his quest&#x2014;just in time, too, as a deadly incursion is under way. Hockensmith does not abandon Austen&#x2019;s original characters. Mrs. Bennett is the most true to the original, and even silly Kitty and Lydia are the same, only they fight instead of fuss over men. Elizabeth, from whose point of view significant elements of the story are told, is the most fully developed, and while she departs a little from the original, it&#x2019;s not so far as to make Austen fans cringe (given that they&#x2019;re OK with zombies, of course). This is a must-read for the growing legion of alternate-Austen fans (including, naturally, everyone who has read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies). --Jessica Moyer</p><h2>Arabic for Life: A Textbook for Beginning Arabic</h2><p><p><i>Arabic for Life</i> takes an intensive, comprehensive approach to beginning Arabic instruction and is specifically tailored to the needs of talented and dedicated students. Unlike the other Arabic textbooks on the market, <i>Arabic for Life</i> is not specifically focused on either grammar or proficiency. Instead, it offers a balanced methodology that combines these goals. Frangieh has created a book that is full of energy and excitement about Arabic language and culture, and it effectively transmits that excitement to students. <i>Arabic for Life</i> offers a dynamic and multidimensional view of the Arab world that incorporates language with Arabic culture and intellectual thought. </p><p>The book is accompanied by a&nbsp;DVD with some eighty videos of native speakers reciting the vocalized texts in the book and dozens of audio recordings covering vocabulary and expressions, drills on Arabic sounds and letters, and various exercises and activities.</p></p><p><p> Bassam Frangieh is professor of Arabic at Claremont-McKenna College.

Frangieh&#x2019;s <i>Arabic for Life: a Textbook for Beginning Arabic </i>is an excellent Arabic language textbook that also provides a cultural journey of the Middle East through beautiful and rich Arabic texts....The book is bright, easy to read and fun. The color pictures add a sense of place that enriches the overall learning experience. The DVD is organized consistently with the lessons in the textbook, and its audio/video recordings, exercises and activities help build vocabulary&#x2014;but equally important it is so alive and fun to watch!...The publication of this book is very timely for beginning students in standard modern Arabic, but intermediate students will also benefit....It is impossible not to admire this serious, comprehensive and beautiful work presented by Frangieh.

These are a few of the questions explored in this nine-week Bible study, which is designed to help Catholics grow in their appreciation of the Holy Spirit and his power to transform their lives in Christ.

In April 2011, she became the first UK recipient of the Sendak Fellowship.PreS-Gr 1-This small book provides an elementary-level look at the way even an acorn plays an important role in the ecosystem. From the acorn comes a tree. The tree is a home to birds that scatter seeds. Seeds become flowers that bear appetizing fruit. The fruit attracts hungry chipmunks that entice hunter snakes. A watchful hawk, however, swoops down to catch its slithering prey. As the hawk stands guard in the oak tree, an acorn falls. And so another tree is born, and another, and soon there is a forest. Each page is laid out with only a few words or a single phrase. The pen-and-ink illustrations have an earth-tone palette and are enhanced digitally. The back matter consists of a glossary of important terms, such as ecosystem and saplings, and provides further information on how acorns nourish the forest animals. A few paragraphs explaining the importance of forests to the environment, specifically those in the Cumberland Plateau, is appended.

If one boat has a round bottom and another's is veed, what difference does it make in the way they perform? What are the advantages of a cutter rig over a sloop? Why does one sailor swear by a full keel, while others won't have anything but a fin keel? Why does one powerboat have more flare in its topsides than another? And what is flare? Why do some hull shapes look "right"? How big an engine and propeller will it take to move that powerboat? What elements make a boat safe, or comfortable? </p><p><i>Understanding Boat Design</i> has been the place to look for quick, uncomplicated answers since 1971. Founder of the Yacht Design Institute, a highly respected designer for more than 30 years, and a frequent contributor to <i>SAIL, Cruising World,</i> and other magazines, Ted Brewer has again revised his classic primer.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, with Bob Wallstrom, he produced more than 100 custom and production designs, from 21-foot catboats to the exquisite 62-foot charter ketch <i>Traveller III</i>. His better-known production designs include the Whitby 42, the Aloha 28 and 34, the Cabot 36, and the Morgan 38. In the early 1970s he originated the much copied radius-bilge method of building metal yachts. </p><p>Brewer's more recent designs include a sailing dinghy, a 45-foot Boston pilot schooner, the 68-foot schooner <i>Tree of Life</i> (named by <i>SAIL</i> magazine as one of the "100 Greatest Yachts in America"), and the 60-foot BOC around-the-world racer <i>Wild Thing</i>. </p><p>He is author of two other books, <i>Cruising Yacht Design</i> and <i>Ted Brewer Explains Sailboat Design</i> (International Marine, 1985), and a contributor to <i>SAIL, Cruising World, Motor Boating &amp; Sailing,</i> and <i>Great Lakes Sailor</i>, among other magazines. </p><p>When not at the drafting table, Brewer cruises the waters of the Pacific Northwest aboard his Nimble 25 Arctic yawl from his home port of Anacortes, Washington.</p>Brewer provides as good a basic introduction to small craft design as you could ever hope to find.

Ellen Wood played upon the anxieties of the Victorian middle classes who feared a breakdown of the social order as divorce became more readily available and promiscuity threatened the sanctity of the family. In her novel the simple act of hiring a governess raises the spectres of murder, disguise, and adultery. Her sensation novel was devoured by readers from the Prince of Wales to Joseph Conrad and continued to fascinate theatre-goers and cinema audiences well into the next century.

It offers brief essays by noted garden writers on topics such as types of gardens around the world (rose, formal, country, flower, Japanese, and tropical), spring bulbs, and public parks. The essays vary in tone and content from Ann Lovejoy's friendly piece on growing flowers, to an obscure history of the philosophical underpinnings of Japanese gardening by Teiji Itoh, and an exciting tour of tropical gardens by Katherine Whiteside. The essays and abundant color photographs highlight the famous gardens where the series was filmed, such as Hidcote Manor and Giverny. Other illustrations include garden plans. This is a handsome book, but much of the visual information will be just as effectively conveyed by videotapes of the series.

Although best known for his contributions to epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of religion, Hume also made substantial and influential contributions to psychology and the philosophy of mind, ethics, the philosophy of science, political and economic theory, political and social history, and to a lesser extent, aesthetic and literary theory. All facets of Hume&#39;s output are discussed in this volume, the first genuinely comprehensive overview of his work. The picture that emerges is of a thinker, who, though critical to the point of skepticism, was nonetheless able to build on that skepticism a profoundly important, and still viable, constructive philosophy.</p><p>David Hume's mother reportedly lamented, "Our Davie is a fine good-natured critter, but uncommon weak-minded." Perhaps she would have been comforted to know that today her son is widely considered to be the most important philosopher ever to have written in the English language. The <i>Companion</i>'s 11 essays take the reader from Hume's precocious <i>Treatise of Human Nature</i>--published in 1739, when he was only 28--to the posthumously published <i>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</i>, and cover not only the subjects central to Hume's philosophy but also his views on politics, economics, literary and aesthetic theory, and even history. As David Wootton's essay observes, the British Library catalog identifies Hume as "the historian"--"to the puzzlement," Wootton quips, "of generations of philosophers." Also included are Hume's two short autobiographies, written in his own inimitable style: he describes the unexcited reaction to his <i>Treatise</i> by saying that "it fell dead-born from the press, without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots." <p> The contributors to the <i>Companion</i> are among the most respected contemporary Hume scholars; their essays are uniformly clear and accessible. Robert J. Fogelin's article on Hume's skepticism, Knud Haakonssen's article on Hume's political theory, and J.C.A. Gaskin's article on Hume's philosophy of religion are particularly worthwhile, as is the substantial bibliography. Although the <i>Companion</i> is not aimed at the specialist, neither is it for the philosophical novice--still, anyone interested in Hume's life and work would benefit from perusing it. <i>--Glenn Branch</i></p>Although he was best known for his contributions to epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of religion, Hume also made substantial and influential contributions to many other disciplines. This first comprehensive overview of his work reveals the full scope of his creativity.</p><h2>Fitness and Wellness</h2><p>Create your own personal fitness and wellness success stories with Hoeger and Hoeger&#39;s FITNESS AND WELLNESS.

Paul Gobee</b>, MD, Assistant Professor, Developer Anatomical E-learning, Department of Anatomy and Embryology, Leiden University Medical Center<br><br> (O. Paul Gobee, MD, Assistant Professor, Developer Anatomical E-learning, Dept. o <i>n/a</i>)<br><br>"The study of anatomy is often a challenging endeavour for many medical students. Central to the learning process is the use of a good textbook. Two of the most often recommended texts for medical students are <b>Gray's Anatomy for Students</b> <b>(GAS), </b>descended from the iconic text by Henry Gray, and <b>Clinically Oriented Anatomy</b> <b>(COA), </b>by Moore, Dalley and Agur.&nbsp;"Both texts employ a regional approach to the study of anatomy. <b>GAS</b> separates each chapter into four sections: <i>Conceptual Overview, Regional Anatomy, Surface Anatomy</i> and <i>Clinical Cases.</i> The conceptual overview aims to provide the very basic concepts of each region in a concise summary before moving on to an increasingly detailed description. While this approach may be useful for the beginner or reviewer, the inevitable repetition creates a degree of redundancy. <b>COA</b> presents information in a 'bones up' format, progressively adding surrounding structures before detailing the arthrology of each region. Each chapter concludes with a series of radiographic images to complement integration and understanding.&nbsp;"Certain striking distinctions are evident in the textual quality of each book. <b>GAS</b> aims to strip away irrelevant information into an easy-to-read summation while leaving intricate details for other texts. While this provides an excellent introduction for the neophyte, <b>COA</b> includes more rigorous explanations concerning the finer points and the complex interaction with surrounding structures. An enlightening example of the differing styles can be observed through the treatment attributed to the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. A concise, tabular description of muscular attachments, innervations and basic function is provided in <b>GAS</b> in association with a stylised diagram indicating its position in the neck. Conversely, <b>COA</b> devotes an entire four page sub-section to a detailed discussion of the manner in which body position and the use of synergist muscle groups can alter function of the SCM beyond an isolated view of the muscle acting independently in the anatomical position. Thus, while simplified to enhance the initial integration of basic concepts, <b>GAS</b> may simultaneously perpetuate certain erroneous notions concerning the nature of anatomical function. On the other hand, the text in <b>COA</b> may reduce its effectiveness for the uninitiated, while <b>GAS</b> may prove to be too simplistic for the interested student.&nbsp; "Both books approach diagrammatical representation through the use of computer-generated imagery, though distinct dissimilarities are visible. <b>COA</b><i> </i>depicts each region by incorporating detailed and realistic diagrams which are thoroughly labelled. In contrast, <b>GAS</b><i> </i>represents analogous images through a distinctly stylised fashion. Major structures are portrayed in an idealistic mode, which, in combination with relatively sparse labelling, may impede practical application, particularly in medical courses focussed on anatomical dissections. However the simplified overview, devoid of extensive detail, is potentially easier to comprehend for the less experienced anatomist. In addition to detailed, accurate labels, <b>COA</b><i> </i>consolidates diagrammatic elements through representations in various anatomical planes. The depiction of distinct layers within each system aids the appreciation of the detailed nature of such structures. Ultimately, <b>COA</b><i> </i>associates these illustrative characteristics through the use of numerous, detailed figures within each specified anatomical region. The use of <b>COA</b><i> </i>may prove to be beneficial, both in dissection and in providing a broader scope of understanding. &nbsp; "The integration of clinical aspects throughout a text is essential to the effective understanding of anatomical information. Both books appear to have achieved a relatively streamlined integration of such information through the utilisation of clinical vignettes. Complemented with relevant diagrams, topics covered in the text of these vignettes include information relating to development, anatomical variation, radiology and &nbsp;pathology. For those without significant exposure to anatomy, having clinical information presented in such a fashion is an ideal mode for the consolidation of vital concepts. The use of end of chapter case studies in <b>GAS</b><i> </i>allows the reader to evaluate their own level of understanding, a feature that is absent in <b>COA</b>. Radiological correlations in <b>GAS</b><i> </i>are discussed further through an in-text approach. Alternatively, <b>COA </b>utilises radiological imaging juxtaposed with easily understood computer generated diagrams, allowing the student to understand the concepts therein with more clarity. <br><br>"Through our experience in both learning and teaching, we believe that <b>COA</b> delivers a more comprehensive insight into the study of anatomy. Not only does it encompass a strong clinical foundation, it provides the reader with enhanced factual information and diagrams. Contrastingly, <b>GAS</b> offers equivalent aspects in a more concise, readable form yet neglects more in-depth explanations. The choice of textbook will ultimately depend on both the school curriculum and the eagerness of individual students. Whilst providing an excellent synopsis into the anatomical world, the possibility exists that students may find <b>GAS</b> lacking after covering the basic concepts. It is our view that <b>COA</b> offers greater scope for continued learning throughout medical school and beyond."&#x2014;<b>Australian Medical Student Journal</b><br><br> (David Sparks, Gareth S.

From the novella "Daisy Miller" and classic short stories such as "The Turn of the Screw" to the popular short novel <em>Washington Square</em> and intricately woven and highly complex later novels such as <em>The Golden Bowl</em> and <em>The</em> <em>Ambassadors</em>, James's work is a required stop on any journey through our nation's artistic and cultural heritage. <br> An undisputed masterpiece, <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em> is arguably James's most popular work, and certainly the finest of his early novels. It focuses on Isabel Archer, a young, intelligent, and spirited American girl, determined to relish her first experience of Europe. She rejects two eligible suitors in her fervent commitment to liberty and independence, declaring that she will never marry. Thanks to the generosity of her devoted cousin Ralph, she is free to make her own choice about her destiny. Yet in the intoxicating worlds of Paris, Florence, and Rome, her fond illusions of self-reliance are twisted by the machinations of her friends and apparent allies. What had seemed to be a vista of infinite promise steadily closes around her and becomes instead a "house of suffocation."<br> <em>Portrait of a Lady</em> is at once a dramatic Victorian tale of betrayal and a wholly modern psychological study of a woman caught in a web of relations she only comes to understand too late.

Out of their deadly rivalry, Thomas McGuane has constructed a novel with the impetus of a thriller and the heartbroken humor that is his distinct contribution to American prose.</p><p><p>Thomas McGuane lives in McLeod, Montana. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the author of ten novels, three works of nonfiction, and three collections of stories.</p>"Full of surprises and rewards and an exhilaration one feels only rarely....

Few works have captured the seamy side of American urban life with such graphic intensity.</p><p>The novelist Frank Norris is almost forgotten today, but in books like &#34;McTeague,&#34; published in 1899, he paved the way for a whole generation of American writers--a generation that included Theodore Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis and, less directly, Hemingway and Fitzgerald. McTeague is a dentist saddled with a grasping wife, and the book chronicles his rise and fall in awkward but powerful prose. This type of social realism, so contrary to the uplifting entertainment of the day (and to Mark Twain&#39;s more fanciful, comic novels), provided turn-of-the-century America a disturbing mirror in which to view itself.An unflinchingly realistic portrayal of the moral descent of a San Francisco dentist, <b>McTeague</b>, first published in 1899, helped to propel American literature into the twentieth century. "The novel glows in a light that makes it the first great tragic portrait in America of an acquisitive society," writes Alfred Kazin in the Introduction to this Modern Library Paperback Classic. "McTeague's San Francisco is the underworld of that society, and the darkness of its tragedy, its pitilessness, its grotesque humor, is like the rumbling of hell. Nothing is more remarkable in the book than the detachment with which Norris saw it&#x2014;a tragedy almost literally classic in the Greek sense of the debasement of a powerful man&#x2014;and nothing gives it so much power."</p><h2>The True Account: Concerning a Vermont Gentleman&#39;s Race to the Pacific Against and Exploration of the Western American Continent Coincident to the Expedition of</h2><p>In the spring of 1804, Private True Teague Kinneson -- schoolmaster, inventor, playwright, and explorer -- sets out with his nephew, Ticonderoga, to race Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to the Pacific. Along the way True and Ti encounter Daniel Boone and his six-foot-two spinster daughter, Flame Danielle; fight and trick a renegade army out to stop Lewis's expedition; invent baseball with the Nez Perce; hold a high-stakes rodeo with Sacagawea's Shoshone relatives; and outwit True's lifelong adversary, the Gentleman from Vermont, a.k.a. the devil himself. And when a beautiful and mysterious Blackfoot girl named Yellow Sage Flower Who Tells Wise Stories enters the tale, things start to get really interesting.<br> The True Account, which Lawrence Millman calls "part riotous adventure, part book of wonders, and part historical travesty," is the hilarious and sometimes heartbreaking story of a man "whose imagination is unfettered by either convention or fact, whose hopefulness and good nature yield to no force, and whose ways and stays rank second to none in the history of the world."</p><p>HOWARD FRANK MOSHER is the author of ten books, including Waiting for Teddy Williams, The True Account, and A Stranger in the Kingdom, which, along with Disappearances, was corecipient of the New England Book Award for fiction. He lives in Vermont.Vermont<br>1<br>We had set a very close watch over my uncle, Private True Teague Kinneson, <br>since his triumphal return from the Pacific and the Columbia River. I say "we," <br>but in fact, keeping track of the comings and goings of the renowned <br>expeditionary, schoolmaster, inventor, and playwright had, since my early <br>boyhood, devolved mainly to me. My father had his newspaper to print, the <br>Kingdom County Monitor, in which he kept track of the events in our remote <br>little Vermont village. My mother kept track of our family farm, a job that <br>required her entire attention from before dawn until after dark each day. And <br>ours being a very small, if very affectionate, family, this left me to keep track <br>of my uncle. Who, as my father often said, clapping the heels of his hands to <br>his temples and pressing as hard as he was able, as if to keep his brain from <br>exploding, bore much watching.<br> From the time I was six or seven I was the private"s constant <br>companion, pupil, fishing partner, apprentice, and confidant, not to mention <br>his co-expeditionary. Nor is it surprising that we were inseparable, when one <br>stops to think that it was he who christened me Ticonderoga &#x2014; Ti for short &#x2014;<br> after the principal matter of his play and the signal event of his life &#x2014; the fall <br>of the fortress of that name on the narrows of Lake Champlain to Ethan Allen <br>and a handful of Vermont woodsmen and farmers in 1775.<br> Unfortunately, it was that same milestone in the history of our <br>Republic that resulted in Private True Teague Kinneson"s own fall and <br>subsequent affliction &#x2014; or, as my kindhearted mother called his strange <br>disorder of the imagination, his "little ways and stays." As he was drinking <br>rum flip with Ethan and celebrating their victory by singing a ballad, most of <br>which has now been lost to posterity but whose refrain was "Tooleree, <br>toolera, tooleroo," my uncle lost his footing and struck his head so sharp a <br>blow on the gate of the fort that he never, I am grieved to report, quite <br>regained his correct wits.<br><br>2<br>It is an important point of information in the history of the Kinneson family <br>that from the moment of his mishap at Fort Ti, my uncle supposed himself to <br>be constantly engaged in the prosecution of many heroic enterprises. These <br>adventures often involved travel to far-flung places, great raging battles, and <br>encounters with all manner of plenipotentiaries and unusual personages. The <br>hillock behind my mother"s cow barn he called the Heights of Quebec; and <br>many a summer afternoon we stormed it together, taking the Citadel on the <br>Plains of Abraham &#x2014; a large granite boulder atop the hill &#x2014; as he believed <br>he had done with General Wolfe in "59. In the winter, when a thick sheet of <br>ice and snow covered the hill, he stationed me on this boulder in the role of <br>the French commander, Montcalm, and had me repel his assaults by <br>pushing him whirling back down the frozen slope on the seat of his woolen <br>pantaloons &#x2014; a terrifying spectacle to me and to my parents, calling up in <br>our recollections his fateful accident of years before. There was no doubt, <br>from my uncle"s easy talk of embrasures, fortifications, enfilades, scaling-<br>ladders, and cannonadings, that he fully imagined himself to have been <br>present at the fall of Quebec. But when I drew my father aside and asked him <br>privately whether True had been involved in that battle, his hands shot up to <br>his head and he said that, while he ruled out no improbability when it came to <br>his older brother, if he had been, he was the youngest foot-soldier in the <br>history of the world &#x2014; being, according to my father"s calculations, but seven <br>years of age at the time.<br> Sometimes my uncle and I journeyed to the rapids on the St. <br>Lawrence just west of Montreal to reenact a historic meeting between the <br>explorer Jacques Cartier and my great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, <br>Chief Tumkin Tumkin of the Abenaki tribe. Hearing that Cartier was searching <br>for China and the Great Khan, and learning something of the dress and <br>customs of that distinguished emperor, Tumkin Tumkin had stationed himself <br>just upriver from the rapids in a robe of muskrat pelts dyed bright vermilion, <br>with an absurd little round yellow hat on his head; his design was to <br>impersonate the Celestial Personage and receive whatever gifts the French <br>explorer had laid aside for him. In the event, Cartier instantly saw through our <br>ancestor"s ruse, but was so amused that he gave Tumkin Tumkin his second-<br>best chain-mail vest and named the region of the rapids Lachine &#x2014; or China, <br>as it is called to this day.<br> The cedar bog to the north of our farm my uncle designated <br>variously as the Great Dismal Swamp, or Saratoga, or Yorktown. From it we <br>routed many a vile Redcoat, every last one of whom we put to the sword. For <br>Private True Teague Kinneson was a ruthless soldier and showed no mercy <br>to his captives. In his capacity as an inventor, he attached a sail made from <br>an old flannel sheet to my little fishing raft on the Kingdom River, where we <br>played by the hour at Captain Cook and the South Sea Cannibals. And when <br>the ice began to form on my mother"s stock pond, we recreated the scene of <br>Washington crossing the Delaware.<br> During the long Vermont winters, when the wind came howling <br>down out of Canada and the drifts lay six feet deep between the house and <br>the barn, my uncle taught me Latin and Greek and astronomy and <br>mathematics and the physical sciences. He read to me by the hour from <br>both the ancients and moderns, and in the evenings we frequently cleared <br>away my mother"s kitchen table and chairs and performed scenes from <br>Homer or Virgil.<br> "Arma virumque cano," he would roar out in his booming stage <br>voice. And it was off to the races with the brave hero of the Aeneid, while my <br>mother, baking the next day"s bread or peeling apples or doing the farm <br>accounts in her black daybook, smiled, and my father"s ink-stained hands <br>shot headward. When we undertook the Iliad, my mother sometimes agreed <br>to play the part of Helen, and my uncle and I carried her in her rocker from <br>the window by the door to the chimney corner we called Troy; and indeed, <br>with her tall slender form and long golden hair and eyes as blue as the sky <br>over the Green Mountains on the fairest day of summer, she fit the role of <br>Helen as well as any woman could. But on another occasion my uncle <br>mistook my father for a Cyclops and chased him round and round the kitchen <br>with the fire poker.<br> "None of this is your fault, Ti," my terrified sire cried from the other <br>side of the barricaded woodshed door. "Above all, remember that none of this <br>is your fault."<br> Well. I had never supposed that my uncle"s little ways and stays <br>were my fault, or anyone else"s, including his. Nor did I for a single moment <br>believe that he meant the least harm to my father or any other creature in the <br>universe. Though as my uncle"s own history amply illustrated, accidents <br>would happen; and perhaps it was as well for my father that he had the <br>presence of mind to retreat until our version of the Odyssey had ended with <br>the hero"s return to Ithaca and his loving Penelope. Penelope was my <br>mother"s cat.<br> My uncle"s favorite play, however, was his own. I shall come to <br>that drama very soon. But first, a few words about the appearance of the <br>playwright himself.<br><br>3<br>Private true Teague Kinneson &#x2014; I refer to him by his full title because my <br>uncle set great store by his military rank &#x2014; was very tall and very lanky, with <br>sloping, rugged shoulders, a trim, soldierly mustache, and keen yellow eyes <br>that appeared to be as pitiless as a hawk"s, though in fact he was the most <br>sympathetic man I have ever known. He wore, over his scout"s buckskins, <br>Jacques Cartier"s chain-mail vest, which had been handed down in our family <br>from Tumkin Tumkin and which he believed had saved his life in battle a <br>dozen times over; a copper dome, which had been screwed to the crown of <br>his head by the regimental surgeon who operated on him after his fall at Fort <br>Ti; a loose-fitting pair of galoshes, whose tops he rolled up to his bony knees <br>for winter and down around his ankles for summer; a red sash about his <br>middle somewhat resembling an Elizabethan codpiece; and, to cover the <br>shining metal crown of his head, a red woolen night-stocking with a harness <br>bell on the end, like the bell of a fool"s cap, to remind himself where he was <br>at all times, and also that "compared to the Almighty Jehovah, all men are <br>fools."<br> My uncle was somewhat hard of hearing from being so much <br>subjected to cannon fire over the course of his military expeditions, so he <br>carried at all times a tin ear trumpet as long as my mother"s yard measure. <br>On those expeditions he went armed with a homemade wooden sword; an <br>arquebus with a great bell-like mouth, of such incredible antiquity that even <br>he was uncertain of its origin, though family tradition had it that this ancient <br>firelock had been used by his Kinneson grandfather on the field of battle at <br>Culloden just before the clan moved from Scotland to Vermont; and a large <br>black umbrella to keep off the sun and rain, embellished on top with the <br>family coat of arms &#x2014; a crossed pen and sword, signifying that from time <br>immemorial Kinnesons had "lived by the one and died by the other."<br><br>When not off adventuring, my uncle divided his time between his playwriting, <br>his angling, his books, my education, his garden, and his inventions. To <br>begin with the play. He had been working on his Tragical History of Ethan <br>Allen, or The Fall of Fort Ticonderoga for twenty years and more. He styled it <br>a tragedy because he believed Colonel Allen to have been much undervalued, <br>and indeed thought that the old Vermonter should have been our first <br>president. It was a long play, running well over three hours. And on the <br>occasions when he had arranged for it to be performed, it had not met with a <br>very kindly reception, even in our own state. From certain hints my uncle <br>himself had let drop, I feared that it had been roundly hissed off the stage. <br>But he had the greatest faith in the world in his Tragical History, and pegged <br>away at it year after year, firmly believing it to be nothing short of a <br>masterpiece-in-progress. What pleased him most about the play was that it <br>violated none of Aristotle"s dramatic unities. Aristotle the Greek philosopher, <br>pupil of Plato, and chronicler of all branches of human knowledge known to <br>his time? No, sir. Scholia Scholasticus Aristotle &#x2014; my uncle"s great tutor <br>during his time at Oxford University &#x2014; of whom you will soon hear more.<br> When it came to angling, my uncle loved to cast flies, like our <br>Scottish ancestors. In fact, he and my father were both avid fly-casters and <br>had taught me this noble art when I was very young. We three enjoyed many <br>a fine May morning on our little river, enticing native brook trout to the lovely <br>feathered creations that my uncle tied during winter evenings. He fashioned <br>long, limber rods from elm and ash poles, wove fine horsehair leaders, and <br>was the neatest hand in all Kingdom County at laying his high-floating <br>colored artifices deftly over rising fish. There was just one difficulty. Private <br>True Teague Kinneson was so tenderhearted that he could not bear to kill his <br>catch, and so released every last trout he caught unharmed to the cold <br>waters from which it had come. Yet no man ever enjoyed the art of fly-fishing <br>more or took more pains to match his flies to the natural insects emerging on <br>the water; and the sight of my copper-crowned uncle, rod held high and bent, <br>playing a fine splashing trout, and crying, for all the world to hear, "Hi, hi, fish <br>on!" was a most splendid spectacle.<br> My uncle"s books, of which he had many hundreds in several <br>languages, he kept in his snug little schoolhouse-dwelling behind our <br>farmhouse, which dwelling he called the Library at Alexandria. He spared no <br>expense when it came to purchasing these volumes, and he supported his <br>scholarly avocation with the proceeds from his garden in my mother"s loamy <br>water meadow near the river. There he tended half an acre of the tall, forest-<br>green plants known as cannabis, whose fragrant leaves and flower buds he <br>ground into a mildly euphoric smoking tobacco very popular in Vermont and <br>of which he himself faithfully smoked half a pipeful each evening after supper.<br> Of all his books, my uncle loved best a hefty old tome bound in <br>red buckram called The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote de La Mancha &#x2014; <br>of which he believed every last syllable to be the revealed gospel truth. In <br>fact, it was partly in honor of this same ingenious gentleman that my uncle <br>wore his chain mail and polished his copper crown until it shone like the top <br>of a cathedral. For ever since his accident, he had fancied himself something <br>of a modern-day knight-errant. Yet it was not giants disguised as windmills <br>that he sought to fight but the Devil himself &#x2014; until he cast that horned fellow <br>out of the Green Mountains in a tow sack, in consequence of which <br>expulsion he feared that "the Gentleman from Vermont," as he termed Old <br>Scratch, might be doing great mischief elsewhere.<br><br>Being a kind of perpetual boy himself, though a big one, my uncle was a <br>great favorite with all the boys and girls in the village, for whom he invented <br>huge kites, spinning whirligigs, velocipedes with sails, magic lanterns, <br>catapults, wheeled siege-towers, fire-ships, rockets, and I don"t know what <br>else &#x2014; none of which ever, to the best of my knowledge, had the slightest <br>practical application. Besides his vast fund of classical stories and poems, <br>he knew a thousand tales of witches, ghouls, and ghosties, in the telling of <br>which he terrified no one so much as himself. He was deathly afraid of large <br>dogs, small serpents, lightning &#x2014; he had been struck eight times since the <br>installation of his copper crown, and it was said in the village that, like a tall <br>ash tree in a Vermont hedgerow, he "drew electricity" &#x2014; and of nearly all <br>women, though he had the greatest respect for and confidence in my mother, <br>as did my father and I.<br> One of my uncle"s most curious inventions was a wooden, Dutch-<br>style shelf clock, about a foot and a half tall, without any works or innards but <br>with a very passable painting he had done on it of his hero Quixote, that <br>Knight of the Woeful Countenance, doing combat with a windmill. The painted <br>hands of this clock were set forever at twenty minutes past twelve, which <br>hour had a triple significance to my uncle. First, he was utterly certain that <br>this was perpetually the correct time at Greenwich, England, so that by <br>knowing the hour where he was, and the altitude of the sun, he could always <br>calculate his correct longitude and divine where he was in the universe. And it <br>distressed him not in the least that no matter how many times he made <br>these calculations, his position never came out the same twice but varied <br>wildly, from the longitude of Calcutta to that of Venice.<br> The second point of significance concerned a saying in our family, <br>which was that whenever a lull fell over the conversation, it must be twenty <br>after the hour.

That was fifteen years and a whole lifetime ago. Even then, backstabbing and betrayal erupted among the women in the group, a trio of which are now gathered around a hospital bed.

It started at their senior year graduation party when a group of daredevils led by Tanner slipped under the safety rope and tumbled into the dangerous, fast-flowing river. One of their clique died following his lead. It all seemed spontaneous at the time. A thoughtless deed.

Few noted that a �10 Austen banknote was already in existence, albeit one issued by her brother. Henry Austen had set up as a banker in 1804, and built up a small empire of country banks. But Henry went unmentioned, and for good reason&#x2015;he had gone spectacularly bust in the crash of 1816, the year before Jane died.</p><p>Versions of Henry appear throughout her novels, not least in the charming but unscrupulous Henry Crawford in Mansfield Park, master of the fashionable card game Speculation. In her last novels, Jane worked through her increasing doubts about the speculative mindset and the shock caused by the collapse of Henry's enterprise.</p><p>Exploring the close parallels between the speculative political economy of the late eighteenth century and that of the present day, <em>Jane Austen: The Banker's Sister</em> counters the stereotype of the spinster tucked away in a Hampshire village, detached from the great historical changes of her era. Based on wholly new research, including sensational new evidence of Henry's entanglements in the dissolute circle around the Prince Regent, this fascinating new volume will change the way Austen's life and her novels are understood.</p><p><strong>E.

Even though girls are not trained on the great looms there, Th�r�se practices on a small one at home and dreams of becoming a royal weaver someday.<br> &nbsp;<br> This charming story follows Th�r�se as she carries out an ambitious plan with the help of family, friends, and the artisans of the Gobelins. The intricate craft of tapestry weaving is illuminated, and surprises await Th�r�se, her parents and brothers, and even the king himself. Children&#x2019;s book author Alexandra S. D. Hinrichs here breathes vivid life into a delightful tale full of fun twists and an appealing cast of characters.<br> &nbsp;<br> Original paintings by award-winning artist Ren�e Graef playfully illustrate the book, as well as the many steps involved in the creation of the famous Gobelins tapestries, from dyeing wool and making silver thread, to painting and copying the elaborate designs, to the delicate art of weaving.<br> &nbsp;<br> Th�r�se&#x2019;s fictional adventures are inspired by real people, the actual Gobelins Manufactory, and a beautiful tapestry that hangs today in the J.

She splits her time between Los Angeles and Milwaukee.<br> &nbsp;Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Inspired by a tapestry on display at the J. Paul Getty Museum, this fictional tale of a family who work and live at the historic Gobelins Manufactory transports readers to 17th-century Paris. A third-person narrator reveals how a young girl creates a small tapestry for her father, a court painter for Louis XIV. Mother and daughter wind yarn onto spools for brother Mathieu to skillfully weave while father and brother Henri paint the scenes that inspire these beautiful tapestries, which are destined for palace walls. Though girls traditionally did not weave, Th�r�se is so touched by a small painting of the palace in winter that her father gives her that she is moved to create a tapestry of it to surprise him. When King Louis pays a visit, he notices her small but carefully crafted piece and wants it for himself. Quick-thinking Henri saves the day, leaving all happy and satisfied. A loving family and determined young protagonist make this lengthy, somewhat special picture book more accessible. Endpapers feature a map of the Manufactory, which includes a weaving workshop, a painting studio, and more. Rich, detailed illustrations help readers understand the tools, materials, and process of creating a tapestry as well as how people dressed and lived during this period.

(Chronology, No. 1)</h2><p>Recorded history is a finely-woven magic fabric of intricate lies about events predating the sixteenth century. There is not a single piece of evidence that can be reliably and independently traced back earlier than the eleventh century. This book details events that are substantiated by hard facts and logic, and validated by new astronomical research and statistical analysis of ancient sources.</p><p>"History: Fiction or Science?" crowns 30 years of meticulous and extensive research performed by the eminent mathematician Anatoly Fomenko and his colleagues. This research started in fact as a unbelievable byproduct of russian-american competition in Moon exploration, when famous NASA scientist Robert Newton discovered a very strange phenomenon in lunar mechanics. This book is also the first volume in seven comprising "Chronology", the fundamental oeuvre that exposes and expounds the numerous inveracities of the traditional version of history. <p>"History: Fiction or Science?" contains data and conclusions that aren&#x2019;t anything short of revolutionary. The alternatives offered to classical history are stunning, unorthodox to the extent of being labelled heretical by virtually every scholar of history, and daring enough to be considered preposterous at first sight, although this impression never lasts longer than it takes one to read a few pages attentively. </p><p>In chapter I we are reminded of when the contemporary chronological scale was created and by whom, with the culprits named as the XVI-XVII century clergy that was in charge of all matters historical in that age. We also learn that the consensual model of history had prominent critics ever since its creation &#x2013; among them such names as Sir Isaac Newton and Jean Hardouin, chief librarian of Louis XIV, the Sun King of France. </p><p>The author dissects every historical age and analyses the data from every source imaginable &#x2013; Roman and Egyptian chronology take a good beating, and it goes rapidly downhill from there. Poggio Bracciolini and Petrarch take the blame for creating the legend of a mythical Classical age that never was. </p><p>The Biblical events are moved a lot closer to us historically, as well as geographically (the Biblical Jerusalem being identified with the mediaeval Constantinople, for instance). The New and the Old Testament swap their positions on the chronological scale, both exposed as referring to mediaeval events. Our perception of history changes dramatically even before we&#x2019;re through with chapter I. </p><p>In chapters II, III and IV the author summons astronomy and statistics to provide proof for his theories, which the latter yield gladly and abundantly, and we discover that our amazement resource was by no means used up in the previous chapter. Apparently, there is some vary valid astronomical proof for the author&#x2019;s theories in the ancient Egyptian zodiacs, Ptolemy&#x2019;s Almagest, and the Biblical Book of Revelation. </p><p>Chapters V and VI contain in-depth descriptions of the methods used by the author as well as the most meticulous rendition of the global chronological map with its numerous errors and glitches explained in a very level-headed manner &#x2013; one doesn&#x2019;t have to be a mathematician to understand, but a great deal of common sense is required for that purpose. </p><p>Finally, in chapter VII we learn more about Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and how the division between the two exists in our mind only (which is a hard concept to accept, even though we familiarize ourselves with it at the beginning of the book). If this isn&#x2019;t enough, the appendices contain all sorts of factual information to appease the sceptics as well as provide fresh New Chronology converts with deadly ammunition for keeping the critics well at bay. </p><p>Basically, this is the <b>first successful attempt to finally transform history into a rocket science</b> and a must read for everyone who isn&#x2019;t entirely indifferent to human history,... and possibly also for those who are. </p><p>Dear prospective Reader, we have the pleasure to invite You to use the 'Search Inside' feature to acquaint Youself with the book.</p>The historical discourse appears to enjoy unwavering popularity in an abundance of manifestations. However, we have to ask ourselves this: how often do we question the veracity of the dominating historical discourse? Could it be that the historical inveracities are really a lot graver than the ones inevitably resulting from temporal distance and entropy? What if the passions of Jesus Christ (as we may observe them in Mel Gibson&#x2019;s rendition coming Christmas) took place in the XI-XII century AD and not in the first? And what if the walls of Troy &#x2013; the ones that we&#x2019;re bound to see stormed by Brad Pitt &amp; Co in the nearest future &#x2013; have really been located elsewhere? Could Troy be identified with Constantinople, for instance? Basically, the main idea behind this is that the chronological scale that we use nowadays is elongated to a great extent and completely arbitrarily, being a collation of several versions of one and the same temporal sequence that eventually became identified with several nonexistent historical periods. It isn&#x2019;t too hard to label the results of our research "sensationalist drivel", and indeed that seems to be the number one argument offered by the venerable community of fundamentalist historians. However, if we are to think critically and employ both common sense and rationality to the fullest extent and not just nominally, remaining bound by our a priori views and opinions all the while, we shall see numerous holes, gaps, and blanks that the traditional version of history pretends not to notice.</p><h2>Targeting Pronunciation: Communicating Clearly in English</h2><p>Targeting Pronunciation uses an interactive approach and clear explanations to help students communicate effectively in English.

Wilkie Collins' masterpiece is particularly distinguished by the appearance of Sergeant Cuff, a prototype of the English detective hero and the harbinger of a popular tradition of sleuthing.</p><p>The Broadview Literary Texts series is an effort to represent the ever-changing canon of literature in English by bringing together texts long regarded as classics with valuable, though lesser-known literature.The elements which make up The Moonstone- a purloined Indian jewel which carries with it a mysterious curse, a stolid British police sergeant, a drama of theft and murder in a spacious country home- have been repeated, in slightly varying guises, throughout much of the detective fiction that Wilkie Collins&#39; immensely popular 1868 novel gave birth to.</p><h2>Sources of Korean Tradition, Vol. 2: From the Sixteenth to the Twentieth Centuries</h2><p>Modeled after the classic <i>Sources of Chinese Tradition, Sources of Japanese Tradition,</i> and <i>Sources of Indian Tradition,</i> this collection of seminal primary readings in the social, intellectual, and religious traditions of Korea from the sixteenth century to the present day lays the groundwork for understanding Korean civilization and demonstrates how leading intellectuals and public figures in Korea have looked at life, the traditions of their ancestors, and the world they lived in. <br><br>The selections range from the mid- and late Chos�n dynasty in the sixteenth century, through the encounter with the West and imperialist Japan in the late ninteenth and early twentieth centuries, to the political and cultural events in South and North Korea since 1945&#x2015;ending with President Kim Taejung's 1998 inaugural address.</p><p>This collection of seminal primary readings in the social, intellectual, and religious traditions of Korea from the sixteenth century to the present day lays the groundwork for understanding Korean civilization and demonstrates how leading intellectuals and public figures in Korea have looked at life, the traditions of their ancestors, and the world they lived in.<b>Y�ngho Ch'oe</b> is professor of history at the University of Hawaii. <br><br><b>Peter H.

His father--a farmer turned carpenter from whom Whitman acquired his freethinking intellectual and political attitudes--moved his wife and nine children to Brooklyn in 1823.&nbsp;<br><br>Whitman suffered a stroke in 1873 and was forced to retire to Camden, New Jersey, where he would spend the last twenty years of his life. There he continued to write poetry, and in 1881 the seventh edition of&nbsp;<i>Leaves of Grass</i>&nbsp;was published to generally favorable reviews. However, the book was soon banned in Boston on the grounds that it was 'obscene literature.' Whitman was in a precarious financial way in his remaining years, and such writers as Mark Twain, Henry James, and Robert Louis Stevenson contributed to his support. Rich admirers kept him supplied with oysters and champagne (he was fond of both). Whitman even received a visitation from Oscar Wilde, who later reported that 'the good gray poet' made no effort to conceal his homosexuality from him. ('The kiss of Walt Whitman,' Wilde said, 'is still on my lips.')<br><br>In January 1892 the final 'Death-bed Edition' of&nbsp;<i>Leaves of Grass&nbsp;</i>appeared on sale, and Whitman's life's work was complete. He died two months later on the evening of March 26, 1892, and was buried four days afterward at Harleigh Cemetery in Camden. 'Most of the great poets are impersonal,' Whitman once wrote of&nbsp;<i>Leaves of Grass.</i>'I am personal. . . . In my poems, all revolves around, concentrates in, radiates from myself. I have but one central figure, the general human personality typified in myself. But my book compels, absolutely necessitates, every reader to transpose himself or herself into the central position, and become the living fountain, actor, experiencer himself or herself, of every page, every aspiration, every line.'1.<br> Among The Multitude<br> An Army Corps On The March<br> As I Lay With My Head In Your Lap Camerado<br> Cavalry Crossing A Ford<br> Crossing Brooklyn Ferry<br> The Dalliance Of The Eagles<br> A Glimpse<br> Halcyon Days<br> A Hand-mirror<br> I Hear America Singing<br> I Saw In Louisiana A Live-oak Growing<br> Me Imperturbe<br> My Picture-gallery<br> Native Moments<br> A Noiseless Patient Spider<br> O Tan-faced Prairie-boy<br> Old Salt Kossabone<br> Out Of The Cradle Endlessly Rocking<br> Passage To India<br> Perfections<br> Poets To Come<br> Reconciliation<br> Roots And Leaves Themselves Alone<br> The Runner<br> A Sight In Camp In The Daybreak Gray And Dim<br> The Sleepers<br> So Long!<br> Sometimes With One I Love<br> Song Of Myself<br> Starting From Paumanok<br> There Was A Child Went Forth<br> These Carols<br> To A Stranger<br> A Twilight Song<br> Vigil Strange I Kept On The Field One Night<br> When I Heard At The Close Of The Day<br> When Lilacs Last In The Dooryard Bloomed<br> Whispers Of Heavenly Death<br> Whoever You Are Holding Me Now In Hand<br> The Wound-dresser<br> Youth, Day, Old Age And Night<br> -- <i>Table of Poems from Poem Finder�</i></p><h2>Public Health 101: Healthy People&#x2015;Healthy Populations</h2><p>From clean drinking water, to seat belts, to immunizations, the impact of public health on every individual is undeniable.

Not only did he publish some 250 works, but he also wrote lectures, diaries, and thousands of letters that have not been published. This book&#x2015;the second and final volume of Tim Hilton&#x2019;s acclaimed biography of Ruskin, which is published on the centenary of Ruskin&#x2019;s death&#x2015;draws on the original source material to give a moving account of the life of this brilliant and creative man.<br><br>The book begins in 1859, when Ruskin, a famous author with a disastrous marriage behind him, is living with his parents, writing and traveling, and tutoring&#x2015;among other pupils&#x2015;Rose La Touche, a girl of ten, with whom he slowly falls in love. Hilton recounts how this relationship developed into one of the saddest love affairs of literary history, ending in tragedy in 1875. Thereafter, says Hilton, Ruskin&#x2019;s life was punctuated by bouts of insanity and despair that culminated in total breakdown for the last ten years of his life. During these years, however, his intellect and imagination reached new heights, as he produced <i>Praeterita </i>and<i> </i>most of <i>Fors Clavigera, </i>the series of monthly letters to British workers. Hilton&#x2019;s magisterial narrative follows Ruskin through this period and shows that he was the most eloquent and radical of all the great Victorian writers.<br><br></p><p>Beginning in 1859, the second volume of Tim Hilton's sterling biography of John Ruskin chronicles much suffering and sadness, as well as spiritual and artistic growth. The deaths of his beloved parents, in 1864 and 1871, snapped Ruskin out of self-indulgence and a tendency to complain. His love for Rose La Touche, only 9 years old when he met her in 1858 and appalled when he declared his feelings in 1866, would last throughout this morbidly pious girl's lingering illness and beyond her death in 1875. He had bouts of mental illness that finally incapacitated him in the decade before his death in 1900. Yet these were also the years in which Ruskin wrote his fascinating autobiography, <i>Praeterita</i>, and the innovative <i>Fors Clavigera</i>. Hilton believes this series of 96 pamphlets addressed to British workers to be Ruskin's masterpiece, a revelation of "the continuing life of the mind" as their author ranged from Dante to the English Poor Laws to the iconography of the penny. Hilton discusses these and the underlying themes of Ruskin's life with remarkable clarity and an impressive range of knowledge. He enables modern readers to decipher the idiosyncratic thoughts and feelings of a great Victorian who was "a glory of the nation's literature, and an important part of its social conscience." <i>--Wendy Smith</i><b>Tim Hilton</b>, a regular contributor to the <i>Times Literary Supplement </i>and<i> </i>other journals has written the catalogues of a number of significant exhibitions and has taught both painting and art history in several British art schools and universities. <br></p><h2>Imperium in Imperio (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p>Self-published in 1899 and sold door-to-door by the author, this classic African-American novel&#x2014;a gripping exploration of oppression, miscegenation, exploitation, and black empowerment&#x2014;was a major bestseller in its day.

In the order of their ages, the names of her children were: James Henry, aged fifteen, Amanda Ann, aged thirteen, Eliza Jane, aged eleven, Belton, aged eight, and Celestine, aged five. Several years previous to the opening of our history, Mr. Piedmont had abandoned his wife and left her to rear the children alone.<br><br>School opened in October, and as fast as she could get books and clothing Mrs. Piedmont sent her children to school. James Henry, Amanda Ann, and Eliza Jane were sent at about a week&#x2019;s interval. Belton and Celestine were then left&#x2014;Celestine being regarded as too young to go. This morning we find Belton&#x2019;s mother preparing him for school, and we shall stand by and watch the preparations.<br><br>The house was low and squatty and was built of rock. It consisted of one room only, and over this there was a loft, the hole to climb into which was in plain view of any one in the room. There was only one window to the house and that one was only four feet square. Two panes of this were broken out and the holes were stuffed with rags. In one corner of the room there stood a bed in which Mrs. Piedmont and Amanda Ann slept. Under this was a trundle bed in which Eliza Jane and Celestine slept at the head, while Belton slept at the foot. James Henry climbed into the loft and slept there on a pallet of straw. The cooking was done in a fireplace which was on the side of the house opposite the window. Three chairs, two of which had no backs to them, completed the articles in the room.<br><br>In one of these chairs Mrs. Piedmont was sitting, while Belton stood before her all dressed and ready to go to school, excepting that his face was not washed.<br><br>It might be interesting to note his costume. The white lady for whom Mrs. Piedmont washed each week had given her two much-torn pairs of trousers, discarded by her young son. One pair was of linen and the other of navy blue. A leg from each pair was missing; so Mrs. Piedmont simply transferred the good leg of the linen pair to the suit of the navy blue, and dressed the happy Belton in that suit thus amended. His coat was literally a conglomeration of patches of varying sizes and colors. If you attempted to describe the coat by calling it by the name of the color that you thought predominated, at least a half dozen aspirants could present equal claims to the honor. One of Belton&#x2019;s feet was encased in a wornout slipper from the dainty foot of some young woman, while the other wore a turned over boot left in town by some farmer lad who had gotten himself a new pair. His hat was in good condition, being the summer straw last worn by a little white playfellow (when fall came on, this little fellow kindly willed his hat to Belton, who, in return for this favor, was to black the boy&#x2019;s shoes each morning during the winter).<br><br>Belton&#x2019;s mother now held in her hand a wet cloth with which she wished to cleanse his face, the bacon skin which he gnawed at the conclusion of his meal having left a circle of grease around his lips. Belton did not relish the face washing part of the programme (of course hair combing was not even considered). Belton had one characteristic similar to that of oil. He did not like to mix with water, especially cold water, such as was on that wet cloth in his mother&#x2019;s hand. However, a hint in reference to a certain well-known leather strap, combined with the offer of a lump of sugar, brought him to terms.<br><br>His face being washed, he and his mother marched forth to school, where he laid the foundation of the education that served him so well in after life.<br><br>A man of tact, intelligence, and superior education moving in the midst of a mass of ignorant people, ofttimes has a sway more absolute than that of monarchs.<br><br>Belton now entered the school-room, which in his case proves to be the royal court, whence he emerges an uncrowned king.</p><h2>Skeletal Muscle Structure, Function, and Plasticity: The Physiological Basis of Rehabilitation</h2><p>In its Third Edition, this text addresses basic and applied physiological properties of skeletal muscle in the context of the physiological effects from clinical treatment.

Evans-Wentz, M.A., D.Litt., D.Sc. <p>Jesus College, Oxford; Author of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa, Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, etc. </p><p>The value of Yogananda's Autobiography is greatly enhanced by the fact that it is one of the few books in English about the wise men of India which has been written, not by a journalist or foreigner, but by one of their own race and training--in short, a book about yogis by a yogi. As an eyewitness recountal of the extraordinary lives and powers of modern Hindu saints, the book has importance both timely and timeless. To its illustrious author, whom I have had the pleasure of knowing both in India and America, may every reader render due appreciation and gratitude. His unusual life-document is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu mind and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be published in the West. </p><p>It has been my privilege to have met one of the sages whose life-history is herein narrated-Sri Yukteswar Giri. A likeness of the venerable saint appeared as part of the frontispiece of my Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines*(1). It was at Puri, in Orissa, on the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He was then the head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chiefly occupied in the spiritual training of a group of youthful disciples. He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the people of the United States and of all the Americas, and of England, too, and questioned me concerning the distant activities, particularly those in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa Yogananda, whom he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his emissary to the West. </p><p>Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and worthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic. He had chosen as his place of earthly abode the holy city of Puri, whither multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province of India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath, "Lord of the World."

She elected to specialize in critical care&#x2014;to become an ICU physician&#x2014;and imagined herself swooping in to rescue patients from the brink of death. But&nbsp;then during&nbsp;her first code&nbsp;she found herself cracking the ribs of a patient so old and frail it was unimaginable he would ever come back to life. She began to question her choice.<br> <i><br> Extreme Measures&nbsp;</i>charts&nbsp;Zitter&#x2019;s&nbsp;journey from wanting to be one kind of hero to becoming another&#x2014;a doctor who prioritizes the patient&#x2019;s values and preferences in an environment where the default&nbsp;choice is the extreme&nbsp;use of technology. In our current medical culture, the old and the ill are put on what she terms&nbsp;the End-of-Life&nbsp;&nbsp;Conveyor belt. They are intubated, catheterized, and even shelved away in care facilities to&nbsp;suffer&nbsp;their final days alone, confused, and often in pain. In her work Zitter has learned what patients fear more than death itself:&nbsp;the prospect of dying badly. She builds bridges between patients and caregivers, formulates plans to allay patients&#x2019; pain and anxiety, and enlists the support of loved ones so that life can end well, even beautifully.<br><br> Filled with rich patient stories that make&nbsp;a&nbsp;compelling medical narrative,&nbsp;<i>Extreme Measures&nbsp;</i>enlarges the national conversation as it thoughtfully and compassionately examines an experience that defines being human.</p><p><b>Jessica Nutik Zitter, M.D., MPH,</b> is an expert on the medical experience of death and dying. She attended Stanford University and Case Western Reserve Medical School, and completed her residency in internal medicine at the Brigham and Women&#x2019;s Hospital in Boston. She was a fellow in pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of California San Francisco. Zitter is double-boarded in the two specialties of pulmonary/critical care medicine and palliative care medicine&#x2014;a rare combination. She writes for <i>The New</i> <i>York Times</i>, <i>The Huffington Post</i>, <i>Pacific Standard</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, and <i>Journal of</i> <i>Palliative Medicine</i>, and is featured in <i>Extremis</i>, an Oscar-nominated Netflix documentary about end-of-life decision-making in an ICU."Like Atul Gawande's <i>Being Mortal</i>, Zitter's book shows how knowing when do to nothing is as vital to being a good doctor as knowing when do to everything."<br><b>&#x2014;<i>New York Times Book Review<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;Jessica here reveals a fuller truth of how the end-of-life plays out within our healthcare system.

His father was a worker and an anarchist; Walter himself is a Communist. In the 1930s, he left Mussolini&#x2019;s Italy to fight Franco in Spain. After Franco&#x2019;s victory, he left Spain for exile in the United States. With the end of the war, he returned to Italy to work as a labor organizer and to build a new revolutionary order. Now, in the late 1950s, Walter is a deputy in the Italian parliament. <br><br>He is not happy about it. Parliamentary proceedings are too boring for words: the Communist Party seems to be filling up with ward heelers, timeservers, and profiteers. For Walter, the political has always taken precedence over the personal, but now there seems to be no refuge for him anywhere. The puritanical party disapproves of his relationship with Nuccia, a tender, quizzical, deeply intelligent editor who is separated but not divorced, while Walter is worried about his health, haunted by his past, and increasingly troubled by knotty questions of both theory and practice. Walter is, always has been, and always will be a Communist, he has no doubt about that, and yet something has changed. Communism no longer explains the life he is living, the future he hoped for, or, perhaps most troubling of all, the life he has led.</p><p><b>Guido Morselli </b>(1912&#x2013;1973) spent his youth in Milan, where his father was an executive with a pharmaceutical company. When he was twelve his mother died from Spanish flu, an event that devastated the reserved child. After attending a Jesuit-run primary school and a classical secondary school, Morselli graduated from the Universit� degli Studi di Milano with a law degree in 1935. Instead of practicing law, however, he embarked on a long trip around the Continent. Though he wrote consistently from the remote town in the lake region of Lombardy where he lived alone, Morselli succeeded in publishing only two books over the course of his life: the essays <i>Proust o del sentimento</i> (Proust, or On Sentiment, 1943) and <i>Realismo e fantasia</i> (Realism and Invention, 1947). His many works of fiction, journalism, and philosophy were repeatedly rejected by publishers, and, frustrated by his perceived failures, he committed suicide in 1973. Hanging in his library was the motto <i>Etiam si omnes, ego non</i> (Though all do it, I do not). In fact, Morselli&#x2019;s nine posthumously published novels, among them <i>Roma senza papa</i> (Rome Without the Pope, 1974), <i>Divertimento 1889</i> (1975), and <i>Dissipatio H.G.</i> (The Dissolution of the Human Race, 1977), enjoyed considerable critical success. Morselli left his farm and lands to the town of Gavirate in his will, and today Parco Morselli looks south onto Lago di Varese and north toward the Alpine foothills.<br><br><b>Frederika Randall</b> is a writer and a translator of Italian literature.

This traditional text consistently reinforces the following common thread: learn a skill; practice the skill to help solve equations; and then apply what you have learned to solve application problems. This simple, straightforward approach has helped many students grasp and apply fundamental problem solving skills necessary for future mathematics courses. Algebraic ideas are developed in a logical sequence, and in an easy-to-read manner, without excessive vocabulary and formalism. The open and uncluttered design helps keep students focused on the concepts while minimizing distractions. Problems and examples reference a broad range of topics, as well as career areas such as electronics, mechanics, and health, showing students that mathematics is part of everyday life.</p><p>Jerome E. Kaufmann received his Ed.D. in Mathematics Education from the University of Virginia. Now a retired Professor of Mathematics from Western Illinois University, he has more than 30 years of teaching experience at the high school, two-year, and four-year college levels. He is the author of 45 college mathematics textbooks.</p><h2>Beauty and the Beast (Disney Classic Series)</h2><p>Through her great capacity to love, a kind and beautiful maid releases a handsome prince from the spell which has made him an ugly beast</p><p></p><h2>The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson by Bernard Bailyn (1974) Hardcover</h2><p>Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson, The by Bailyn, Bernard</p><p><b>Bernard Bailyn</b> is Adams University Professor, Emeritus, and Director of the International Seminar on the History of the Atlantic World, Harvard University. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution</i> (Pulitzer and Bancroft Prizes) and <i>The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson</i> (National Book Award), both published by Harvard.Professor Bailyn has written a biography that is a work of art: exquisitely written, delicate in insight, and imbued with a wisdom about men and affairs that is the true hallmark of a great historian. (J. H. Plumb <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>As political biography, <i>The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson</i> is without equal in the voluminous literature on the Revolution. No other public figure of the Revolution has found such skillful and sensitive attention. (Jack P. Greene <i>History</i>)<br><br>Writing this kind of history requires discipline, imagination, and sensitivity, and it presupposes that there is an inner world of intellect and of moral and emotional sensibility which is intimately responsive to external events... His probing, taut yet luminous prose weaves together into a single fabric finished explanations, analyses of evidence, flashes of insight, and intuitive understandings. A triumph of historical and literary artistry...<i>The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson</i> is that rare achievement which is at once original and nearly definitive, masterful and provocative. (Robert M.

Pongo Twistleton knows his debonair but wild uncle shouldn&#x2019;t really be allowed at large &#x2013; especially when disguised as a brain surgeon. He fears the worst. And his fears are amply justified.</p>P. G. WODEHOUSE wrote more than ninety novels and some three hundred short stories over 73 years. Perhaps best known for the escapades of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse also created the world of Blandings Castle, home to Lord Emsworth and his cherished pig, the Empress of Blandings. His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler&#x2019;s Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club.

Each chapter makes the key concepts transparent and accessible to a reader with minimal background in either neurobiology or psychology and is extensively illustrated with full-color photographs and figures depicting important concepts and experimental data. Like the First Edition, the Second Edition is organized into three parts. However, each part has been expanded to include new chapters or reorganized to incorporate new findings and concepts.<br><br>Part One introduces the idea that synapses modified by experience provide the basis for memory storage. It next describes the long-term potentiation methodology used to study how synapses are modified and concepts needed to understand the organization of synapses. The remaining chapters are organized around the idea that the synaptic changes that support long-term potentiation evolve in four overlapping stages referred to as (a) generation, (b) stabilization, (c) consolidation, and (d) maintenance. The goal of each chapter is to reveal that each stage depends on unique molecular processes and to describe what they are.<br><br>Part Two builds on this foundation to show how molecules and cellular processes that have been identified from studies of synaptic plasticity also participate in the making of memories. It discusses some of the basic conceptual issues researchers face in trying to relate memory to synaptic molecules and describes some of the behavioral and neurobiological methods that are used. The chapters describing the processes involved in memory formation and consolidation have been extensively modified to provide a more detailed account of the molecular events that are engaged to ensure that established memories endure. The chapters on memory modulation and the fate of retrieved memories have been extensively modified to provide a more in-depth account of the relevant processes.<br><br>Part Three is organized around the multiple memory systems view--that different neural systems have evolved to store the content contained in our experience. It features discussion of the medial-temporal hippocampal system that supports episodic memory, the concept of systems consolidation, and its relationship to Ribot's law--that memories become resistant to disruption as they age. The cortical-striatal system and its relationship to what are called behavioral actions and habits is described, and the book ends with a discussion of neural systems involved in the acquisition and removal of emotional memories.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jerry W.

Aided by the invention of the printing press in Europe, travelers were able to spread their accounts to wider audiences than ever before. In <em>Travel Narratives from the Age of Discovery</em>, historian Peter C. Mancall has compiled some of the most important travel accounts of this era. Written by authors from Spain, France, Italy, England, China, and North Africa describing locations that range from Brazil to Canada, China to Virginia, and Angola to Vietnam, these accounts provided crucial insight into unfamiliar cultures and environments, and also betrayed the prejudices of their own societies, revealing as much about the observers themselves as they did about faraway lands.<br>From Christopher Columbus to lesser-known figures such as the Huguenot missionary Jean de L�ry, this anthology brings together first-hand accounts of places connected by the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. Unlike other collections, <em>Travel Narratives from the Age of Discovery</em> offers a global view of travel at a crucial stage in world, and human, history, with accounts written by non-European authors, including two new translations. Included here are the Mughal Emperor Babur's first thoughts of India upon establishing his empire there, the Chinese chronicler Ma Huan's report detailing Chinese travel to the Middle East during the fifteenth century, and an account of Africa written by the man known as Leo Africanus. In addition to these travel narratives, this anthology features rare pictures from sixteenth-century printed books, including images of Brazil, Roanoke, Guiana, and India, which, together with the accounts themselves, provide a detailed understanding of the many ways in which fifteenth and sixteenth century travelers and readers imagined other worlds.<br></p><p>"Peter Mancall has skillfully juxtaposed narratives of voyages to Africa, Asia, America and Europe over two hundred years. He lets us see the world through European eyes--though a few non-Europeans tell their fascinating tales--and inspires us think anew about the uses of description."--Natalie Zemon-Davis, author of <i>Trickster Travels: A Sixteenth-Century Muslim Between Worlds</i> <p>"Truly global and comparative, Mancall's rich and useful anthology puts the travels of Europeans like Columbus, Vespucci, Raleigh, and L�ry in company with those of a Ming admiral, a Moroccan ambassador, a Mogul emperor, and an Inca lord. Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas all receive attention in this dazzling blend of the familiar and strange."--Mary C. Fuller, author of <i>Voyages in Print</i></p><br><strong>Peter C.

The editors and contributors describe how instruction should evolve to meet the writing standards of the Common Core. The volume also addresses important writing skills and processes that are not addressed in the CCSS but are necessary for a balanced, comprehensive writing program. It distills a dense body of research into a highly readable synthesis of what is core and critical to K-12 writing instruction. For current or aspiring teachers--as well as administrators whose responsibilities include leading, supporting and developing teachers--this is a 'must read.'"--Catherine D'Aoust, MS, Co-Director, University of California, Irvine Writing Project<br><br>&#x201c;Provides a great deal of research, examples, and strategies to improve writing instruction for teachers. The inclusion of CCSS and focus on 21st century writing skills makes this a highly relevant volume. The authors and editors recognize and reiterate that, though this is a volume on best practices, more than simple strategy implementation is necessary to truly make headway toward effective writing instruction; paradigm shifts toward better motivation, more relevant assessment, and supporting student transference of writing skills across contexts are central to the purposes of this book. That is where this volume rises above many of its peers as it is not simply a repository, but it acts as a guide for making necessary improvements to the writing instruction U.S. students are receiving. This text represents exhaustive research and practice of writing instruction that improves student performance.

The sixth edition of this comprehensive anthology addresses the two key issues confronted by readers approaching Shakespeare today: a lack of knowledge about the historical period and difficulty with the language of Shakespeare's plays. A richly illustrated general introduction offers insight into Shakespeare's England and background on the literary and cultural contexts in which Shakespeare wrote and produced plays. Each play is introduced by a descriptive essay designed to help the reader appreciate the cultural contexts and interpretive issues raised by the play -- without dictating their interpretations. Thoroughly revised and updated notes and glosses provide additional support to understanding the language of Shakespeare's time. </p></p><p><p> <b>The Complete Works of Shakespeare, Sixth Edition<br> David Bevington</b></p><b> </b> <p>Why do we need a new edition of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays?

My attempt has been [constantly] to reeducate myself, to learn more about the complexities of meaning and the innumerable alternative possibilities that present themselves to the student of Shakespeare. Above all, I have tried to learn how to improve accessibility and clarity for today&#x2019;s reader in the interpretation of this extraordinary body of dramatic literature.<br> My hope is that the sixth edition offers students and general readers the most accessible and usable Shakespeare anthology on the market.&#x201d;</p> <br> <p>Surely one of today&#x2019;s premier Shakespeare scholars, David Bevington is also an extraordinary teacher whose concern is always how to make these remarkable plays compelling for every reader.

In 1871 Rudyard and his sister, Trix, aged three, were left to be cared for by a couple in Southsea, England. Five years passed before he saw his parents again. His sense of desertion and despair were later expressed in his story "Baa Baa, Black Sheep" (1888), in his novel <i>The Light That Failed</i> (1890), and in his autobiography, <i>Something of Myself</i> (1937). As late as 1935, Kipling still spoke bitterly of the "House of Desolation" at Southsea: "I should like to burn it down and plough the place with salt." Kipling and his wife settled in Brattleboro, Vermont, where Kipling wrote <i>The Jungle Book</i><b> </b>(1894), <i>The</i> <i>Second Jungle Book</i> (1895), and most of <i>Captains Courageous</i> (1897).

Craving wealth and a position in society, she charms, hoodwinks, manipulates everyone she meets, rising in the world as she attaches herself to a succession of rich men. Becky's fortunes are contrasted with those of her best friend Amelia, who has none of Becky's wit and vitality but whose gentle-heartedness attracts the devotion of the loyal Dobbin. <br><br>Set during the Napoleonic wars, <em>Vanity Fair</em> follows Becky as she cuts a swathe through Regency society. Thackeray paints a panoramic portrait of the age, with war, money and national identity his great subjects. The battle for social success is as fierce as the battle of Waterloo, and its casualties as stricken. The satire is at once biting and profound, sparing none in a clear-eyed exposure of a world on the make. Thackeray's scepticism of human motives borders on cynicism yet <em>Vanity Fair</em> is among the funniest novels of the Victorian age. This new edition includes all Thackeray's original illustrations. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong><br>For over 100 years <em>Oxford World's Classics</em> has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.

A panoramic and biting satire, it was the first of William Makepeace Thackeray&#39;s works to bear his own name. This edition includes his original illustrations and preface.<i>Vanity Fair</i> is a story of two heroines--one humber, the other scheming and social climbing--who meet inboarding school and embark on markedly different lives. Amid the swirl of London's posh ballrooms and affairs of love and war, their fortunes rise and fall. Through it all, Thackeray lampoons the shallow values of his society, reserving the most pointed barbs for the upper crust. What results is a prescient look at the dogged pursuit of wealth and status--and the need for humility.</p><h2>Kierkegaard&#39;s Attack Upon &#34;Christendom&#34; 1854-1855</h2><p><p>A religious diatribe written from within the Church against the established order of things in a presumably "Christian" land.</p></p><p></p><h2>By Steppe, Desert, and Ocean: The Birth of Eurasia</h2><p><em>By Steppe, Desert, and Ocean</em> is nothing less than the story of how humans first started building the globalized world we know today. Set on a huge continental stage, from Europe to China, it is a tale covering over 10,000 years, from the origins of farming around 9000 BC to the expansion of the Mongols in the thirteenth century AD. <br><br>An unashamedly "big history", it charts the development of European, Near Eastern, and Chinese civilizations and the growing links between them by way of the Indian Ocean, the silk Roads, and the great steppe corridor (which crucially allowed horse riders to travel from Mongolia to the Great Hungarian Plain within a year). Along the way, it is also the story of the rise and fall of empires, the development of maritime trade, and the shattering impact of predatory nomads on their urban neighbours. <br><br>Above all, as this immense historical panorama unfolds, we begin to see in clearer focus those basic underlying factors--the acquisitive nature of humanity, the differing environments in which people live, and the dislocating effect of even slight climatic variation--which have driven change throughout the ages, and which help us better understand our world today.</p><p><br><strong>Barry Cunliffe</strong> taught archaeology in the Universities of Bristol and Southampton and was Professor of European Archaeology at the University of Oxford from 1972 to 2008, thereafter becoming Emeritus Professor.

A century of genetic research shows that DNA differences inherited from our parents are the consistent life-long sources of our psychological individuality&#x2015;the blueprint that makes us who we are. This, says Plomin, is a game changer. </p><p>Plomin has been working on these issues for almost fifty years, conducting longitudinal studies of twins and adoptees. He reports that genetics explains more of the psychological differences among people than all other factors combined. Genetics accounts for fifty percent of psychological differences&#x2015;not just mental health and school achievement but all psychological traits, from personality to intellectual abilities. Nature, not nurture is what makes us who we are.</p><p>Plomin explores the implications of this, drawing some provocative conclusions&#x2015;among them that parenting styles don't really affect children's outcomes once genetics is taken into effect. Neither tiger mothers nor attachment parenting affects children's ability to get into Harvard. After describing why DNA matters, Plomin explains what DNA does, offering readers a unique insider's view of the exciting synergies that came from combining genetics and psychology.</p></p><p>Robert Plomin is Professor of Behavioural Genetics at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience at King's College London. He previously held positions at the University of Colorado Boulder and Pennsylvania State University. He was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences and of the British Academy for his twin studies and his groundbreaking work in behavioral genetics.

But even as he lay dying, the truth was too difficult for him to share, and it was his wife who told Bliss that her WASPy, privileged Connecticut childhood had come at a price. Ever since his own parents, New Orleans Creoles, had moved to Brooklyn and began to &#34;pass&#34; in order to get work, Anatole had learned to conceal his racial identity. As he grew older and entered the ranks of the New York literary elite, he maintained the fa�ade. Now his daughter Bliss tries to make sense of his choices and the impact of this revelation on her own life. She searches out the family she never knew in New York and New Orleans, and considers the profound consequences of racial identity. With unsparing candor and nuanced insight, Broyard chronicles her evolution from sheltered WASP to a woman of mixed race ancestry.</p><p>Bliss Broyard is the author of the collection of stories, My Father, Dancing, which was a New York Times Notable Book of the year. Her fiction and essays have been anthologized in Best American Short Stories, The Pushcart Prize Anthology and The Art of the Essay, and have appeared in Grand Street, Ploughshares, The New York Times, Elle Magazine and elsewhere. She lives in Brooklyn with her husband and daughter.Reviewed by Jonathan Yardley<p>For most of the 1970s and '80s, Anatole Broyard was a staff book critic for the New York Times, writing two or three reviews a week for its daily pages, as opposed to its Sunday book section. My own career in that same line of work was just getting under way, and I paid close attention to what he was doing. He obviously was intelligent and erudite, but I sometimes felt that he was more interested in showing his technical skills than in giving books deep, fair readings. Still, he enjoyed considerable influence and was widely known in literary circles.</p><p>Broyard died in October 1990 after a long, painful and debilitating struggle against cancer, but continuing interest in him was insured by the disclosure that he was, as his wife told their two adult children, "part black." According to Bliss Broyard, "My mother explained that my father had 'mixed blood,' and his parents were both light-skinned Creoles from New Orleans, where race-mixing had been common. She said that his parents had to pass for white in order to get work in 1930s New York, which confused my father about what their family was, or was supposed to be." Broyard's response to this, as he moved from Brooklyn to Greenwich Village and began to live a bohemian life in the postwar years, was to "pass for white." He did so for the rest of his life, though many who knew him were aware, or suspected, that his racial identity was not precisely as he presented it.</p><p>Six years after Broyard's death, the New Yorker published an article by Henry Louis Gates, the well-known professor of African American studies, called "The Passing of Anatole Broyard," which was, predictably, the cause of much heated gossip in literary, journalistic and publishing circles. Now Broyard is back in the news with the appearance of this family history and memoir by his daughter. One Drop, Bliss Broyard tells us, takes its title from "the 'one-drop rule,' which classified as black any Americans with the tiniest fraction -- just one drop -- of 'black blood.' It had grown out of a practice dating back to slavery known as hypodescent, which assigned someone of mixed parentage to the lower-status race, and had become the legal and social custom in the era of legalized 'Jim Crow' segregation." The book is an account of her effort to discover just "how black" her father was and thus, obviously, "how black" she is.</p><p>It's a peculiar book. The author's sincerity and honesty are evident and appealing, and her subject is of continuing interest and importance even now, when an appreciable amount of heat has been drained from our old obsessions and fears about race. The problem is that One Drop is actually at least five books -- her father's story, her own story, her family's story, the story of "passing" and the story of racial identity in the United States -- and its author doesn't do a very good job of weaving them together into a seamless, coherent narrative. For well over 100 pages, she wanders this way and that, telling this story and that, interviewing this person and that, circling around the one story of greatest interest -- her father's -- but never really pouncing on it. Then she takes a detour of nearly 200 pages to explore the Broyard family's history in New Orleans. Not until she gets past page 300 does she finally focus fully on her father, and one can't help wondering how many readers she will have lost by then.</p><p>"My father had left behind so much unfinished business," she writes, and her hope is to wrap it up. This would be a difficult task in any circumstances, but it is all the more so in this case because of the exceedingly complex life, character and legacy of Anatole Broyard. He was by most accounts immensely charming and energetic, positively catnip to women (and quick to take advantage of it). But he was also boastful and vain, as well as an operator who, as one friend told Gates, was "exorbitantly in control" and "fastidious about managing things." Thus it is extremely difficult, for example, to figure out why he chose to pass for white, or to get much sense of how this choice weighed on him, as anecdotal evidence suggests it did.</p><p>He was born in New Orleans in 1920, into a family that had been there since the early 1750s when Etienne Broyard, "a white man from France . . . landed in the Louisiana Territory." Within a century "the Broyards had begun to be identified in public records as mulatto or free people of color." Bliss Broyard's research has convinced her that "the moment of mixing in the Broyard family" occurred in 1855, when her great-great-grandfather married a free woman of color. Her account of how subsequent generations of the family dealt with (or ignored) this legacy is interesting, but she insists on larding it up with a boilerplate history of American laws, controversies and customs regarding race. By her own honest admission she knew almost nothing about race in America until her father's secret was revealed, and to her credit she studied it closely; it really was not necessary, though, to regurgitate so much of what she learned -- most of which will be familiar to many readers -- in this book, which is too long by about 150 pages.</p><p>It's also unfortunate that she spends so much time fretting about her racial identity. The notion of crossing "from white to the other side" clearly has some appeal for her, and when her New Orleans relatives call her "pure white," she is uncomfortable, yet she just can't let go: "It had been nearly a decade since my father had died, since I'd learned of his -- and my -- African ancestry, since I'd begun reading and learning and talking about race. And despite my glimmerings of double consciousness, I didn't yet feel black. I was still waiting for an 'Aha!' moment, an affirmation of this identity down deep in my bones." Fortunately, within just a few pages of this unbearably PC declaration, Broyard admits that "the thought of how blinded I'd been in my obsession to find a slave ancestor made me feel sick with shame," which redeems her, as does this: "I hated the image of myself in [a black acquaintance's] eyes -- a silly white girl making a big fuss over nothing. I hated how uncertain I became when trying to locate myself on this racial landscape or even recognize its terrain. Torn between trying to pinpoint the boundaries between black and white and an urge to deny their existence at all, I was caught in a dialectical tug-of-war. The futility of my efforts reminded me of a skit I once saw in which a man kept moving a wooden chair around an empty white room, unable to find a spot that suited him, despite their being all the same."</p><p>As she seems finally to have understood, the whole notion of race is fraught with ambiguity. I won't reveal the results of the DNA tests she finally had done, but what they proved more than anything else is that racial identity is a complete mare's nest. In issues of race as in so many others, "Know thyself" is an injunction almost impossible to obey. Notions of racial purity are as false as notions of racial impurity; there's no such thing, though much of human history has been frittered away by people trying to legitimize race as the defining element in what passes for civilization.</p><p>Still, it's not really surprising that Anatole Broyard chose to live as he did. He didn't look in the least bit "black," and he wanted to enter the world of literature, which in the 1940s and '50s in this country was patently "white." He placed personal ambition ahead of racial identity or racial solidarity or whatever one cares to call it, and his daughter makes a pretty solid argument for him: "My father truly believed that there wasn't any essential difference between blacks and whites and that the only person responsible for who he was supposed to be was himself." To be sure, a black friend had a point when he "sniped that my dad was black when he entered the subway in Brooklyn and white when he got out at West Fourth Street in Manhattan," but that's the choice he made, and he managed to live with it.</p><p>His daughter asks: "Was my father's choice rooted in self-preservation or in self-hatred? Did it strike a blow for individualism or for discrimination? Was he a hero or a cad?" Those are good questions, and as Bliss Broyard well understands, they can never be definitively answered, though my own hunch is that "All of the above" gets somewhere close to the truth.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

The author explains the basic theories of cognition, learning, and emotion that underlie available ESTs and shows how the theories also guide systematic case formulation. By crafting a sound formulation and continually refining and monitoring it as treatment progresses, the therapist can smoothly "shift theoretical gears" and weave together elements of different ESTs to meet the needs of individual patients, who typically present with multiple problems. Hands-on tools, reproducibles, and many concrete examples are included. </p></p><p><p><b>Jacqueline B.

We pride ourselves on our ability to multitask&#x2015;read work email, reply to a text, check Facebook, watch a video clip. Talk on the phone, send a text, drive a car. Enjoy family dinner with a glowing smartphone next to our plates. We can do it all, 24/7! Never mind the errors in the email, the near-miss on the road, and the unheard conversation at the table. In <i>The Distracted Mind</i>, Adam Gazzaley and Larry Rosen&#x2015;a neuroscientist and a psychologist&#x2015;explain why our brains aren't built for multitasking, and suggest better ways to live in a high-tech world without giving up our modern technology.</p><p>The authors explain that our brains are limited in their ability to pay attention. We don't really multitask but rather switch rapidly between tasks. Distractions and interruptions, often technology-related&#x2015;referred to by the authors as &#x201c;interference&#x201d;&#x2015;collide with our goal-setting abilities. We want to finish this paper/spreadsheet/sentence, but our phone signals an incoming message and we drop everything. Even without an alert, we decide that we &#x201c;must&#x201d; check in on social media immediately.</p><p>Gazzaley and Rosen offer practical strategies, backed by science, to fight distraction. We can change our brains with meditation, video games, and physical exercise; we can change our behavior by planning our accessibility and recognizing our anxiety about being out of touch even briefly. They don't suggest that we give up our devices, but that we use them in a more balanced way.</p></p><p>Adam Gazzaley is Professor in the Departments of Neurology, Physiology, and Psychiatry at the University of Calfornia, San Francisco, where he is also Founding Director of the Neuroscience Imaging Center, Neuroscape Lab, and the Gazzaley Lab.

Within this 19th century essay, Thoreau explains government of any sort &#x2013; including democracy &#x2013; does not possess more wisdom or justice than its individual citizens, and that it is every citizen&#x2019;s responsibility to avoid acquiescence. More than an essay, Civil Disobedience is a call to action for all citizens to refuse to participate in, or encourage in any way, an unjust institution.</p><p>Henry David Thoreau&#39;s Civil Disobedience was originally published in 1849 as Resistance to Civil Government. Thoreau wrote this classic essay to advocate public resistance to the laws and acts of government that he considered unjust. The practical application of Civil Disobedience was largely ignored until the twentieth century when, at different times, Modanda Ghandi, Martin Luther King, Jr. and anti-Vietnam War activists applied Thoreau&#39;s principles.Henry David Thoreau was born in 1817 in Concord, Massachusetts. He spent time as a school teacher after attending Harvard College but was dismissed for his refusal to administer corporal punishment. In 1845, wanting to write his first book, he moved to Walden Pond and built his cabin on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson. It was during his time at Walden that Thoreau was imprisoned briefly for not paying taxes; this experience became the basis for his well-known essay &#34;Civil Disobedience.&#34; He died of tuberculosis in 1862 at the age of 44.</p><h2>Industrial Organization: Theory and Practice (The Pearson Series in Economics)</h2><p><i>Industrial Organization: Theory and Practice</i>&#x2013;which features early coverage of Antitrust&#x2013;punctuates its modern introduction to industrial organization with relevant empirical data and case studies to show readers how to apply theoretical tools.</p><p><p>Don E.

His adventures lead him into the world of the wealthy and dissipated yachtsmen who swarm the region, and involve him in a strange and unlikely love affair. <br> In this harshly realistic, yet oddly tender and wise novel, Hemingway perceptively delineates the personal struggles of both the "haves" and the "have nots" and creates one of the most subtle and moving portraits of a love affair in his oeuvre. In turn funny and tragic, lively and poetic, remarkable in its emotional impact, <i>To Have and Have Not</i> takes literary high adventure to a new level. As the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> observed, "Hemingway's gift for dialogue, for effective understatement, and for communicating such emotions the tough allow themselves, has never been more conspicuous."</p><p>First things first: readers coming to <i>To Have and Have Not</i> after seeing the Bogart/Bacall film should be forewarned that about the only thing the two have in common is the title. The movie concerns a brave fishing-boat captain in World War II-era Martinique who aids the French Resistance, battles the Nazis, and gets the girl in the end. The novel concerns a broke fishing-boat captain who agrees to carry contraband between Cuba and Florida in order to feed his wife and daughters. Of the two, the novel is by far the darker, more complex work.<p> The first time we meet Harry Morgan, he is sitting in a Havana bar watching a gun battle raging out in the street. After seeing a Cuban get his head blown off with a Luger, Morgan reacts with typical Hemingway understatement: "I took a quick one out of the first bottle I saw open and I couldn't tell you yet what it was. The whole thing made me feel pretty bad." Still feeling bad, Harry heads out in his boat on a charter fishing expedition for which he is later stiffed by the client. With not even enough money to fill his gas tanks, he is forced to agree to smuggle some illegal Chinese for the mysterious Mr. Sing. From there it's just a small step to carrying liquor--a disastrous run that ends when Harry loses an arm and his boat. Once Harry gets mixed up in the brewing Cuban revolution, however, even those losses seem small compared to what's at stake now: his very life.</p><p> Hemingway tells most of this story in the third person, but, significantly, he brackets the whole with a section at the beginning told from Harry's perspective and a short, heart-wrenching chapter at the end narrated by his wife, Marie. In between there is adventure, danger, betrayal, and death, but this novel begins and ends with the tough and tender portrait of a man who plays the cards that are dealt him with courage and dignity, long after hope is gone. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>5 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>McDougal Littell Algebra 1: Notetaking Guide (Student)</h2><p>Student note taking guide for Algebra 1 text and curriculum</p><p></p><h2>Generalist Case Management: A Method of Human Service Delivery</h2><p>Become an effective case manager with GENERALIST CASE MANAGEMENT: A METHOD OF HUMAN SERVICE DELIVERY, 5th Edition.

Do you stall and sputter, like a foot just landed in your mouth? Most of us grope for the right words, feeling unequipped for the task. But we don?t need to respond that way. The words of a friend??your words??can inspire hope and healing. Friendship Counseling provides strugglers with meaningful, life-changing assistance.

Instead, people in pain need &#34;life words&#34;??words that sensitively point strugglers toward building character and drawing closer to God, despite the agony. They offer the safety and compassion that lead to true change rather than to the masking of feelings. If you want to inspire positive change, offer words that heal instead of hurt.

The issues at stake in their disputes ranged from the physical integrity of the air-pump to the intellectual integrity of the knowledge it might yield. Both Boyle and Hobbes were looking for ways of establishing knowledge that did not decay into ad hominem attacks and political division. Boyle proposed the experiment as cure. He argued that facts should be manufactured by machines like the air-pump so that gentlemen could witness the experiments and produce knowledge that everyone agreed on. Hobbes, by contrast, looked for natural law and viewed experiments as the artificial, unreliable products of an exclusive guild.</p><br><p> The new approaches taken in <i>Leviathan and the Air-Pump</i> have been enormously influential on historical studies of science. Shapin and Schaffer found a moment of scientific revolution and showed how key scientific givens--facts, interpretations, experiment, truth--were fundamental to a new political order. Shapin and Schaffer were also innovative in their ethnographic approach. Attempting to understand the work habits, rituals, and social structures of a remote, unfamiliar group, they argued that politics were tied up in what scientists did, rather than what they said. Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer use the confrontation between Hobbes and Boyle as a way of understanding what was at stake in the early history of scientific experimentation. They describe the protagonists' divergent views of natural knowledge, and situate the Hobbes-Boyle disputes within contemporary debates over the role of intellectuals in public life and the problems of social order and assent in Restoration England. In a new introduction, the authors describe how science and its social context were understood when this book was first published, and how the study of the history of science has changed since then.</p></p><p><b>Steven Shapin</b> is the Franklin L.

Their findings suggest the futility of wrenching science from its ideological context, and not only with respect to the seventeenth century; they also detect parallels with the crisis of confidence affecting contemporary science."<b>---Charles Webster, <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>"Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, Winners of the 2005 Erasmus Prize, Praemium Erasmianum Foundation"<br><br>"This is simply one of the most original, enjoyable, and important books published in the history of science in recent years."<b>---Owen Hannaway, <i>Technology and Culture</i></b><br><br>"There is every reason to regard this as one of the most important achievements in science studies in the late twentieth century."<b>---John H.

Professor Moule here provides a reference book which gives guidance on such problems of exegesis. It is a work which presupposes a knowledge of Greek and makes frequent allusions to the standard works; it is intended primarily for theological students. After an introductory section on &#39;The Language of the New Testament&#39; Professor Moule considers in turn particular syntactical divisions (tenses, moods, voices, cases), certain parts of speech and types of clauses, and idiosyncrasies in usage. The last four chapters are &#39;The order of words&#39;, &#39;Semitisms&#39;, &#39;Latinisms&#39;, and &#39;Miscellaneous notes on style&#39;. In each section New Testament usages are defined and distinguished. A number of examples of each type of problem are discussed. They were chosen as being sufficiently representative to provide a guide to the treatment of similar difficulties.</p><p>The student or translator of the New Testament will often find difficulties which can only be solved by considering the syntax of the passage concerned.

A literary icon praised by <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> as "the greatest crime writer of our time, perhaps ever," he has influenced many contemporary writers and is known for both the quality and the accessibility of his writing.</p> <p>In this collection of new and recently published short fiction, Leonard demonstrates the superb characterizations, dead-on dialogue, vivid atmosphere, and driving plotting that have made him a household name. And once more this master of crime illustrates that the line between the law and the lawbreakers is not as firm as we might think.</p> <p>Federal marshal Karen Sisco, from the bestselling novel <em>Out of Sight,</em> returns in "Karen Makes Out," once again inadvertently mixing pleasure with business. In "Fire in the Hole," Raylan Givens, last seen in <em>Riding the Rap</em> and <em>Pronto,</em> meets up with an old friend, but they're now on different sides of the law. In the title story, "When the Women Come Out to Dance," Mrs. Mahmood gets more than she bargains for when she conspires with her maid to end her unhappy marriage. In all nine stories -- each unique in their own right -- reluctant heroes and laid-back lowlifes struggle for power, survival, and their fifteen minutes of fame.</p> <p>Vivid, hilarious, and unfailingly human, these stories ring true with Elmore Leonard's signature deadpan social observations and diabolical eye for the foibles of the good guys and the bad.</p></p><p>What a treat! The nine stories in this collection--some never before published, others available only in anthologies or magazines-- demonstrate why Elmore Leonard has achieved both bestsellerdom and critical acclaim. Ranging in length from a four-page trifle to two novellas of 50-plus pages, these are gems of sly humor, suspense, and, above all, character. Most are in the contemporary crime-fiction vein that made Leonard famous, but a few are more contemplative set pieces, and there's one fine Old West story (Leonard was a Western writer before he became a crime king).<p> Longtime fans will recognize some familiar faces, including the U.S. marshals Raylan Givens, from 1993's <i>Pronto</i> and 1995's <i>Riding the Rap</i>, and Karen Sisco, from 1996's <i>Out of Sight</i> (played by J. Lo in the movie). But whether familiar or new, the people in these stories lunge off the page and seize you by the lapels. Nobody writes character and dialogue like Leonard. In fact, several tales feature some rural white-trash bad guys who are so utterly plausible that you'll look over your shoulder next time you drive a country road.</p><p> The short story format suits Leonard's stripped-down style beautifully. While one or two of the slimmer pieces feel a bit disposable, all nine are engaging, and the best are breathtakingly good--the crispest, best- plotted stuff Leonard has published in years. <i>--Nicholas H. Allison</i></p><p>Elmore Leonard wrote more than forty books during his long career, including the bestsellers <em>Raylan</em>, <em>Tishomingo Blues</em>, <em>Be Cool</em>, <em>Get Shorty</em>, and <em>Rum Punch</em>, as well as the acclaimed collection <em>When the Women Come Out to Dance</em>, which was a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book. Many of his books have been made into movies, including <em>Get Shorty</em> and <em>Out of Sight</em>. The short story "Fire in the Hole," and three books, including <em>Raylan</em>, were the basis for the FX hit show <em>Justified</em>. Leonard received the Lifetime Achievement Award from PEN USA and the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America. He died in 2013.</p></p><h2>The Duff Cooper Diaries</h2><p><p>A witness to numerous significant events from 1914 to 1950, the life of Duff Cooper is explored in full in this collection of diaries. From life as a young soldier at the end of World War I, as a politician during the General Strike of 1926, as King Edward VIII's friend at the time of the Abdication, and to Paris after being liberated in 1944 when he became British ambassador, this reveling and insightful resource is superbly edited by Cooper&#x2019;s son, John Julius Norwich, whose familial link ensures all kinds of additional information as footnotes. With additional details on Cooper&#x2019;s numerous, public love affairs, this enthralling diary captures history as it was being made.</p></p><p>Duff Cooper - as above. John Julius Norwich - his only son - trained as a diplomat, but gave up the Foreign Office to write. He is the premier historian of Venice. He is currently writing a history of the Meditteranean.&#34;a portrait of an equable, intelligent man, by profession a diplomat and politician, in private, a dedicated hedonist, a reckless gambler and bon viveur, with a profound love of literature and an insatiable appetite for beautiful women... good diaries, candid and courageous... as his son, John Julius Norwich, writes in an excellent Introduction.&#34; -- SELINA HASTINGS SUNDAY TELEGRAPH &#34;John Julius Norwich provides a short though admirably well-judged introduction and footnotes identifying all the characters... evident are [Duff Cooper&#39;s] courage, his exuberance, his sense of humour, his lack of pomposity, his warmth, his loyalty. This is a dazzling self-portrait of a man who lived life to the full, relished it enormously and gave much joy to others in so doing.&#34; -- PHILIP ZIEGLER SPECTATOR &#34;enthralling volume, scrupulously edited, is a welcome act of filial homage that brings to life a world that now seems as remoteas Restoration England... a vivid, fascinating... portrait of an age. Frank, amusing and generally well-written... Duff Cooper was a good scholar , had ambitions to be a poet and wrote a fine biography of Talleyrand. Posthumously, with this absorbing portrait of a lost world, has has perhaps completed the book he was born to write.&#34; -- Robert McCrum OBSERVER &#34;His proximity to power, such as his involvement in the abdication crisis as a close friend of Edward VIII&#39;s and his resignation as a cabinet minister in protest at Neville Chamberlain&#39;s appeasement policy, gives his diaries a certain energy, as does the busy whirl of upper class socialising and philandering that seemed to take up so much of his time.&#34; FINANCIAL TIMES &#34;Cooper was a phenomenon. For nearly half a century after 1914, he was close to the centre of events in Britain, and since he was in turn a diplomat, solider, backbench politican, cabinet minister, envoy to Charles de Gaulle&#39;s Free French and then Britain&#39;s post-war ambassador in Paris, he was often a participant in these events. He was clever and gifted... brave&#34; THE ECONOMIST &#34;We must salute the industry and courage of John Julius Norwich and his wife in preparing this highly readable book from what mut have been mountainous material. The notes and link passages are exemplary. The pages on the Abdication are riveting.&#34; -- AN WILSON COUNTRY LIFE &#34;Duff Cooper, an exceptionally fluent writer... could have made a fortune from publishing his own [diaries]... Who but he could offer an insider&#39;s view, not only of the Munich crisis, the general strike and life among the Free French in Algeria, but of Edward VIII in the feverish days before his abdication?... the diaries confirm him to have been a politician of exceptional ability.&#34; -- MIRANDA SEYMOUR SUNDAY TIMES &#34;I thought the Duff Cooper Diaries were interesting and terrific, and also made me envious as hell. Oh, to have lived back then. People sure had fun... Read the Diaries and see how we used to live, and weep.&#34; -- TAKI SPECTATOR &#34;reveals Viscount Norwich&#39;s life as politician, diplomat and socialite. Publication of these highly revealing diaries has long been resisted by Norwich&#39;s family - part of the diaries were nearly burnt as they were considered so shocking.&#34; GOOD BOOK GUIDE &#34;his diaries are a scream... Gorge yourself on his son&#39;s finely tuned edition&#34; TATLER &#34;The great merit - at times the rich delight - of these diaries is as the record of an exuberant, sensual, selfish and ambitious homme du monde living comfortably during uncomfortable times.&#34; -- Richard Davenport-Hines TLS &#34;These diaries are a revelation... The diary is beautifully edited, with notes which provide just the right amount of information, and John Julius Norwich has written a perfectly judged introduction. As a candid record of an extraordinary marriage, this book is gripping.&#34; LITERARY REVIEW &#34;deserve to be read for their candour and compulsive readability.&#34; -- MICHAEL GOVE THE TIMES</p><h2>The Adventures of Sir Lancelot the Great (The Knights&#x2019; Tales Series)</h2><p>Many years ago, the storytellers say, the great King Arthur brought justice to England with the help of his gallant Knights of the Round Table. Of these worthy knights, there was never one so fearless, so chivalrous, so honorable, so?shiny as the dashing Sir Lancelot, who was quite good at defending the helpless and protecting the weak, just as long as he?d had his afternoon nap. Behold the very exciting and very funny adventures of Lancelot the Great, as only acclaimed Arthurian author Gerald Morris can tell them.</p><p>When Gerald Morris was in fifth grade he loved Greek and Norse mythology and before long was retelling the stories to his younger sister and then to neighborhood kids. He began carrying a notebook in which he kept some of the details related to the different stories. The joy he found in retelling those myths continued when he discovered other stories. According to Gerald Morris, &#x201c;I never lost my love of retelling the old stories. When I found Arthurian literature, years later, I knew at once that I wanted to retell those grand tales. So I pulled out my notebook . . . I retell the tales, peopling them with characters that I at least find easier to recognize, and let the magic of the Arthurian tradition go where it will.&#x201d; Gerald Morris lives in Wausau, Wisconsin, with his wife and their three children. In addition to writing he serves as a minister in a church.Chapter 2 The Fastest Knight in England<br><br>In no time at all, the storytellers say, Sir Lancelot became the most famous of all King Arthur&#x2019;s knights in shining armor. No other knight rescued so many damsels in distress or slew so many dragons or overcame so many recreant knights or, for that matter, kept his armor so tidy. He performed so many great deeds that he soon became known as Sir Lancelot the Great. Minstrels sang songs of his adventures, damsels sighed when he passed by, boys playing knights all wanted to be Sir Lancelot, and young knights dreamed of one day defeating Sir Lancelot, because whoever did that, they thought, would be regarded as the greatest knight in England.<br>That last part soon got to be a problem. Everywhere Sir Lancelot went, knights were waiting to challenge him, all hoping to win fame and glory with one battle. Sir Lancelot defeated them all, but fighting every knight he met grew rather tiresome. So, when he rode out on a quest, he chose lonely paths. This was why he was riding alone through a quiet forest one day when he heard an unexpected sound.<br> WAAAAAH!&#x201d; It was a damsel in distress. When you ride out on enough quests, you get to know that sound. Sir Lancelot turned toward the wailing and soon came to a woman sitting alone beneath a great oak tree, crying with gusto.<br> Good day, my lady,&#x201d; Sir Lancelot said politely. It was hard to know the right thing to say at times like this.<br> WAAAAAH!&#x201d; the lady said. Sir Lancelot said, May I be of service, my lady?&#x201d; WOOOO-HOOOO-WAAH!&#x201d; Can you tell me what is distressing you, my lady?&#x201d; WAAAH! BLUH-BLUH-WOO-WAAH!&#x201d; I&#x2019;ll just wait here a bit, then, shall I?&#x201d; WIBBLE-BLIDDER-WO-WO-HAH-WAAH!&#x201d; So Sir Lancelot sat on his horse and waited. No one can cry forever, and when at last the lady had used up all her tears, Sir Lancelot asked again, Can you tell me what is distressing you?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s my . . . my fal-fal-falcon!&#x201d; the lady gasped.<br> Now in those days, noble lords and ladies used to train falcons to hunt for them. They kept them on leashes, then set them free to hunt small birds. A well-trained falcon that is, one that would come back was quite valuable.<br> What happened to your falcon, my lady?&#x201d; It flew away! It was a gift from my husband,&#x201d; the woman wailed, beginning to cry again. Not all falcons were well trained.<br> I&#x2019;m sorry to hear it, my lady,&#x201d; said Sir Lancelot. I wish I could help you.&#x201d; Would you?&#x201d; the woman exclaimed, her tears stopping at once.<br> Er . . . if I could,&#x201d; Sir Lancelot replied. But how? I can&#x2019;t chase a falcon through the sky.&#x201d; Oh, you don&#x2019;t have to chase her at all,&#x201d; the woman said, smiling brightly. She&#x2019;s right up there!&#x201d; The woman pointed up. There at the top of the oak tree was a falcon, her leash tangled in the small branches.<br> Oh,&#x201d; said Sir Lancelot.<br> You said you&#x2019;d help,&#x201d; the woman reminded him.<br> Er . . . yes, I did. The thing is, it&#x2019;s rather hard to climb trees in armor.&#x201d; Can&#x2019;t you take your armor off?&#x201d; the woman asked. She sniffled.<br> Sir Lancelot frowned. He had just had his armor shined and didn&#x2019;t like to leave it lying around. Then he sighed. Of course, my lady.&#x201d; Twenty minutes later, his armor and sword stacked neatly beside a bush, Sir Lancelot began climbing the tree. While he climbed, he wondered how to untangle an angry falcon from a tree without getting pecked, but soon he saw what to do. Coming to the branch where the bird was tangled, he simply broke it off at the base and tossed the whole branch free. Bird and branch fluttered and crashed to the ground, and Sir Lancelot wiped his brow with relief.<br></p><h2>Reasoning and Reading Level 1</h2><p>This book is a complete revision of the original workbook of the same title.

Like most sequels, it repeats many elements from the previous work, <i>Henry IV, Part 1</i>. This play again puts on stage Henry IV&#x2019;s son, Prince Hal, who continues to conceal his potential greatness by consorting with tavern dwellers, including the witty Sir John Falstaff.<br> <br>As in <i>Part 1</i>, Prince Hal and Falstaff seek to best each other in conversation, while Falstaff tries to ingratiate himself with Hal and Hal disdains him. <i>Part 2</i> adds some fresh characters, the rural justices Shallow and Silence and Shallow&#x2019;s household. Political rebellion, while important to the plot, does not loom as large as in <i>Part 1</i>. There are no glorious champions; combat is replaced by deception, cunning, and treachery.<br> <br>The authoritative edition of <i>Henry IV, Part 2</i> from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:<br> <br>-Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play<br> -Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play<br> -Scene-by-scene plot summaries<br> -A key to the play&#x2019;s famous lines and phrases<br> -An introduction to reading Shakespeare&#x2019;s language<br> -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play<br> -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library&#x2019;s vast holdings of rare books<br> -An annotated guide to further reading<br> <br>Essay by A.

Alternating scenes between bawdy tavern and regal court, between revelry and politics, Shakespeare probes at the sources, uses, and responsibilities of power as an old king dies and a young king must choose between a ruler's solemn duty and a merry but dissipated friend, Falstaff. The play represents Shakespeare at the peak of his maturity in writing historical drama and comedy.</p><h2>Power of the Spirit</h2><p>This is a new edition of The Power of the Spirit, written in the 18th century by the esteemed English cleric, William Law, and prepared by Dave Hunt for a contemporary readership.</p><p>William Law was one of the great clerics and educators of the Church of England.

In her third novel, <i>The Forest Lover,</i> Vreeland's subject is the courageous Canadian painter Emily Carr, who traveled through native villages and wilderness of British Columbia in the early 1900s, often alone, on a quest to paint totem poles and other artifacts before the indigenous traditions died out and the poles were destroyed or sold. Vreeland's Carr is deeply respectful of the people she meets, and is rewarded with their trust and their stories. She brings the same sensitivity with her to Paris to see the new art, is exhibited at the Salon d'Automne, and returns to Vancouver in 1912 with a style so direct, and colors so expressive, that a conservative local reviewer dubs her a wild beast, literally, a Fauve. Vreeland's strength is in the tacks of emotion during dialogue, and in her nimble, exact prose. As she depicts her, Carr is an endearing and believable balance of sensitivity and determination&#x2039;an artist of life as well as a remarkable painter. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Susan Vreeland is the award-winning author of the national bestsellers <i>The Passion of Artemisia</i> and <i>Girl in Hyacinth Blue</i>.</p><h2>Designing Tessellations : The Secrets of Interlocking Patterns</h2><p>Designing Tessellations opens the door for quilters to thousands of new and exciting patterns by showing them how to create tessellations--designs made up of the repeated use of seemingly complex but deceptively simple shapes that interlock perfectly to flow across a quilt.

Christine Falls is the first book in Benjamin Black&#39;s celebrated Quirke Dublin series, now a major BBC TV series starring Gabriel Byrne.Chapter One&nbsp;It was not the dead that seemed to quirke uncanny but the living. When he walked into the morgue long after midnight and saw Malachy Griffin there he felt a shiver along his spine that was to prove prophetic, a tremor of troubles to come. Mal was in Quirke's office, sitting at the desk. Quirke stopped in the unlit body room, among the shrouded forms on their trolleys, and watched him through the open doorway. He was seated with his back to the door, leaning forward intently in his steel-framed spectacles, the desk lamp lighting the left side of his face and making an angry pink glow through the shell of his ear. He had a file open on the desk before him and was writing in it with peculiar awkwardness. This would have struck Quirke as stranger than it did if he had not been drunk. The scene sparked a memory in him from their school days together, startlingly clear, of Mal, intent like this, sitting at a desk among fifty other earnest students in a big hushed hall, as he laboriously composed an examination essay, with a beam of sunlight falling slantways on him from a window somewhere high above. A quarter of a century later he still had that smooth seal's head of oiled black hair, scrupulously combed and parted.&nbsp;Sensing a presence behind him, Mal turned his face and peered into the shadowy dark of the body room. Quirke waited a moment and then stepped forward, with some unsteadiness, into the light in the doorway.&nbsp;"Quirke," Mal said, recognizing him with relief and giving an exasperated sigh. "For God's sake."&nbsp;Mal was in evening clothes but uncharacteristically unbuttoned, his bow tie undone and the collar of his white dress shirt open. Quirke, groping in his pockets for his cigarettes, contemplated him, noting the way he put his forearm quickly over the file to hide it, and was reminded again of school.&nbsp;"Working late?" Quirke said, and grinned crookedly, the alcohol allowing him to think it a telling piece of wit.&nbsp;"What are you doing here?" Mal said, too loudly, ignoring the question. He pushed the spectacles up the damp bridge of his nose with a tap of a fingertip. He was nervous.&nbsp;Quirke pointed to the ceiling. "Party," he said. "Upstairs."&nbsp;Mal assumed his consultant's face, frowning imperiously. "Party? What party?"&nbsp;"Brenda Ruttledge," Quirke said. "One of the nurses. Her going-away."&nbsp;Mal's frown deepened. "Ruttledge?"&nbsp;Quirke was suddenly bored. He asked if Mal had a cigarette, for he seemed to have none of his own, but Mal ignored this question too. He stood up, deftly sweeping the file with him, still trying to hide it under his arm. Quirke, though he had to squint, saw the name scrawled in large handwritten letters on the cover of it: Christine Falls. Mal's fountain pen was on the desk, a Parker, fat and black and shiny, with a gold nib, no doubt, twenty-two karat, or more if it was possible; Mal had a taste for rich things, it was one of his few weaknesses.&nbsp;"How is Sarah?" Quirke asked. He let himself droop sideways heavily until his shoulder found the support of the doorjamb. He felt dizzy, and everything was keeping up a flickering, leftward lurch. He was at the rueful stage of having drunk too much and knowing that there was nothing to be done but wait until the effects wore off. Mal had his back to him, putting the file into a drawer of the tall gray filing cabinet.&nbsp;"She's well," Mal said. "We were at a Knights dinner. I sent her home in a taxi."&nbsp;"Knights?" Quirke said, widening his eyes blearily.&nbsp;Mal turned to him a blank, expressionless look, the lenses of his glasses flashing. "Of St. Patrick. As if you didn't know."&nbsp;"Oh," Quirke said. "Right." He looked as if he were trying not to laugh. "Anyway," he said, "never mind about me, what are you doing, down here among the dead men?"&nbsp;Mal had a way of bulging out his eyes and drawing upward sinuously his already long, thin form, as if to the music of a snake charmer's flute. Quirke had to marvel, not for the first time, at the polished luster of that hair, the smoothness of the brow beneath, the untarnished steely blue of his eyes behind the pebble glass of his specs.&nbsp;"I had a thing to do," Mal said. "A thing to check."&nbsp;"What thing?"&nbsp;Mal did not answer. He studied Quirke and saw how drunk he was, and a cold glint of relief came into his eye.&nbsp;"You should go home," he said.&nbsp;Quirke thought to dispute this--the morgue was his territory--but again suddenly he lost all interest. He shrugged, and with Mal still watching him he turned and weaved away among the body-bearing trolleys. Halfway across the room he stumbled and reached out quickly to the edge of a trolley to steady himself but managed only to grab the sheet, which came away in his hand in a hissing white flash. He was struck by the clammy coldness of the nylon; it had a human feel, like a loose, chill cowl of bloodless skin. The corpse was that of a young woman, slim and yellow-haired; she had been pretty, but death had robbed her of her features and now she might be a carving in soapstone, primitive and bland. Something, his pathologist's instinct perhaps, told him what the name would be before he looked at the label tied to her toe. "Christine Falls," he murmured. "You were well named." Looking more closely he noticed the dark roots of her hair at forehead and temples: dead, and not even a real blonde.&nbsp;He woke hours later, curled on his side, with a vague but pressing sense of imminent disaster. He had no memory of lying down here, among the corpses. He was chilled to the bone, and his tie was askew and choking him. He sat up, clearing his throat; how much had he drunk, first in McGonagle's and then at the party upstairs? The door to his office stood open--surely it was a dream that Mal had been there? He swung his legs to the floor and gingerly stood upright. He was light-headed, as if the top of his skull had been lifted clear off. Raising an arm, he gravely saluted the trolleys, Roman-style, and walked stiffly at a tilt out of the room.&nbsp;The walls of the corridor were matte green and the woodwork and the radiators were thick with many coats of a bilious yellow stuff, glossy and glutinous, less like paint than crusted gruel. He paused at the foot of the incongruously grand, sweeping staircase--the building had been originally a club for Regency rakes--and was surprised to hear faint sounds of revelry still filtering down from the fifth floor. He put a foot on the stair, a hand on the banister rail, but paused again. Junior doctors, medical students, nurses beef to the heel: no, thanks, enough of that, and besides, the younger men had not wanted him there in the first place. He moved on along the corridor. He had a premonition of the hangover that was waiting for him, mallet and tongs at the ready. In the night porter's room beside the tall double doors of the main entrance a wireless set was quietly playing to itself. The Ink Spots. Quirke hummed the tune to himself. It's a sin to tell a lie. Well, that was certainly true.&nbsp;When he came out onto the steps the porter was there in his brown dust coat, smoking a cigarette and contemplating a surly dawn breaking behind the dome of the Four Courts. The porter was a dapper little fellow with glasses and dusty hair and a pointed nose that twitched at the tip. In the still-dark street a motorcar oozed past.&nbsp;"Morning, Porter," Quirke said.&nbsp;The porter laughed. "You know the name's not Porter, Mr. Quirke," he said. The way that tuft of dry brown hair was brushed back fiercely from his forehead gave him a look of permanent, vexed surmise. A querulous mouse of a man.&nbsp;"That's right," Quirke said, "you're the porter, but you're not Porter." Behind the Four Courts now a dark-blue cloud with an aspect of grim intent had begun edging its way up the sky, eclipsing the light of an as yet unseen sun. Quirke turned up the collar of his jacket, wondering vaguely what had become of the raincoat he seemed to remember wearing when he had started drinking, many hours ago. And what had become of his cigarette case? "Have you a cigarette itself to lend me?" he said.&nbsp;The porter produced a packet. "They're only Woodbines, Mr. Quirke."&nbsp;Quirke took the cigarette and bent over the cupped flame of his lighter, savoring the brief, flabby reek of burning petrol. He lifted his face to the sky and breathed deep the acrid smoke. How delicious it was, the day's first searing lungful. The lid of the lighter chinked as he flipped it shut. Then he had to cough, making a tearing sound in his throat.&nbsp;"Christ, Porter," he said, his voice wobbling, "how can you smoke these things? Any day now I'll have you on the slab in there. When I open you up your lights will look like kippers."&nbsp;The porter laughed again, a forced, breathy titter. Quirke brusquely walked away from him. As he descended the steps he felt in the nerves of his back the fellow's suddenly laughless eye following him with ill intent. What he did not feel was another, melancholy gaze angled down upon him from a lighted window five stories above, where vague, festive forms were weaving and dipping still.&nbsp;Drifts of soundless summer rain were graying the trees in Merrion Square. Quirke hurried along, keeping close to the railings as if they might shelter him, the lapels of his jacket clutched tight to his throat. It was too early yet for the office workers, and the broad street was deserted, with not a car in sight, and if not for the rain he would have been able to see unhindered all the way to the Peppercanister Church, which always looked to him, viewed from a distance like this down the broad, shabby sweep of Upper Mount Street, to be set at a slightly skewed angle. Among the clustered chimneys a few were dribbling smoke; the summer was almost over, a new chill was in the air. But who had lit those fires, so early? Could there still be scullery maids to haul the coal bucket up from the basement before first light? He eyed the tall windows, thinking of all those shadowed rooms with people in them, waking, yawning, getting up to make their breakfasts, or turning over to enjoy another half hour in the damp, warm stew of their beds. Once, on another summer dawn, going along here like this, he had heard faintly from one of those windows a woman's cries of ecstasy fluttering down into the street. What a piercing stab of pity he had felt for himself then, walking all alone here, before everyone else's day had begun; piercing, and pained, but pleasurable, too, for in secret Quirke prized his loneliness as a mark of some distinction.&nbsp;In the hallway of the house there was the usual smell he could never identify, brownish, exhausted, a breath out of childhood, if childhood was the word for that first decade of misery he had suffered through. He plodded up the stairs with the tread of a man mounting the gallows, his sodden shoes squelching. He had reached the first-floor return when he heard a door down in the hall opening; he stopped, sighed.&nbsp;"Terrible racket again last night," Mr. Poole called up accusingly. "Not a wink."&nbsp;Quirke turned. Poole stood sideways in the barely open doorway of his flat, neither in nor out, his accustomed stance, with an expression at once truculent and timid. He was an early riser, if indeed he ever slept. He wore a sleeveless pullover and a dicky-bow, twill trousers sharply creased, gray carpet slippers. He looked, Quirke always thought, like the father of a fighter pilot in one of those Battle of Britain films or, better still, the father of the fighter pilot's girlfriend.&nbsp;"Good morning, Mr. Poole," Quirke said, politely distant; the fellow was often a source of light relief, but Quirke's mood this early morning was not light.&nbsp;Poole's pale gull's eye glittered vengefully. He had a way of grinding his lower jaw from side to side.&nbsp;"All night, no letup," he said, aggrieved. The other flats in the house were vacant, save for Quirke's on the third floor, yet Poole regularly complained of noises in the night. "Frightful carry-on, bang bang bang."&nbsp;Quirke nodded. "Terrible. I was out, myself."&nbsp;Poole glanced back into the room behind him, looked up at Quirke again. "It's the missus that minds," he said, lowering his voice to a whisper, "not me." This was a new twist. Mrs. Poole, rarely glimpsed, was a diminutive person with a furtive, frightened stare; she was, Quirke knew for a fact, profoundly deaf. "I've lodged a strong complaint. I shall expect action, I told them."&nbsp;"Good for you."&nbsp;Poole narrowed his eyes, suspecting irony. "We'll see," he said menacingly. "We'll see."&nbsp;Quirke walked on up the stairs. He was at his own door before he heard Poole closing his.&nbsp;Chill air stood unwelcoming in the living room, where the rain murmured against the two high windows, relics of a richer age, which no matter how dull the day were always somehow filled with a muted radiance Quirke found mysteriously dispiriting. He opened the lid of a silver cigarette box on the mantelpiece, but it was empty. He knelt on one knee and with difficulty lit the gas fire from the small flame of his cigarette lighter. With disgust he noted his dry raincoat, thrown over the back of an armchair, where it had been all the time. He rose to his feet too quickly and for a moment saw stars. When his vision cleared he was facing a photograph in a tortoiseshell frame on the mantelpiece: Mal Griffin, Sarah, himself at the age of twenty, and his future wife, Delia, laughingly pointing her racquet at the camera, all of them in tennis whites, walking forward arm in arm into a glare of sunlight. He realized with a faint shock that he could not remember where the picture had been taken; Boston, he supposed, it must have been Boston--but had they played tennis in Boston?&nbsp;He took off his damp suit, put on a dressing gown, and sat down barefoot before the gas fire. He looked about the big, high-ceilinged room and grinned joylessly: his books, his prints, his Turkey carpet--his life. In the foothills of his forties, he was a decade younger than the century. The 1950s had promised a new age of prosperity and happiness for all; they were not living up to their promise. His eye settled on an artist's articulated wooden model, a foot high, standing on the low telephone table beside the window, its jointed limbs arranged in a prancing pose. He looked away, frowning, but then with a sigh of annoyance rose and went and twisted the figure into a stance of desolate abasement that would better suit his morning gloom and burgeoning hangover. He returned to the chair and sat down again. The rain ceased and there was silence but for the sibilant hiss of the gas flame. His eyes scalded, they felt as if they had been boiled; he closed them, and shivered as the lids touched, imparting to each other along their inflamed edges a tiny, horrible kiss. Clearly in his mind he saw again that moment in the photograph: the grass, the sunlight, the great hot trees, and the four of them striding forward, young and svelte and smiling. Where was it? Where? And who h...</p><h2>Catland Companion</h2><p>A tribute to Catland shows the mythical world of cats depicted on late Victorian greeting cards, postcards, advertisements, book illustrations, and prints</p><p></p><h2>Journey to the Ice Age: Mammoths and Other Animals of the Wild</h2><p>In Journey to the Ice Age: Mammoths and Other Animals of the Wild, Rien Poortvliet, the famed Dutch illustrator of the highly acclaimed Gnomes and Secrets of the Gnomes, sits in an imaginary seat high up on a ladder and he takes us on a journey back hundreds and thousands of years, making vivid observations of animals, both real and imagined, along the way. Best known for his portrayals and stories of people, animals, and such fantastic creatures as gnomes, Poortvliet gives us a privileged look at animals from both the present and the past and captures their beauty in this newly illustrated volume.<br>Starting in present-day Holland, Poortvliet observes, and illustrates, the many animals who inhabit this earth, in great detail. He may catch a rabbit, lynx, or partridge sauntering by, or admire a doe with her young right beneath him. He takes notice of foxes, deer, and wolves, and portrays them realistically and convincingly.<br>Poortvliet continues on his journey to the sixteenth century, a time when humans coexisted with such predators as bears, lynx, and wolves, and other wild animals. His journey ends with the people and animals of the Ice Age, and he imagines the now-extinct mammoth and other creatures in their natural habitat - the giant deer, the wooly rhinoceros, the wild horse, the auroch, and the cave lion.<br>Exploring the boundaries of time travel and studying the wild animals at close range, Poortvliet documents their daily habits and rituals. His colorful account unfolds before us to reveal the many interesting facts about the mammals: How much bigger is an elk than a deer or a doe? How do you subdue a rhinoceros? How many pounds is a mammoth's daily food intake?<br>Journey to the Ice Age: Mammoths and Other Creatures of the Wild is filled with over 220 pages of full-color illustrations that will bring to life many of these now-extinct animals. Poortvliet's countless fans will be enchanted with this new and intriguing book.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: DutchInternationally acclaimed Dutch illustrator Poortvliet, known best for <i>Gnomes</i> and <i>Secrets of the Gnomes</i>, gives full rein to his love for animals and skill in depicting them in all their glory in this collection of hunting stories, past and present. All the action takes place in the Netherlands, beginning today then quickly moving back in time. Poortvliet begins his time-traveling by recounting family legends, such as the reign of terror of a child-eating wolf. There are less bloodthirsty stories about wild boars, deer, hawks, partridges, bears, otters, beavers, and foxes. As each adventure unfolds, Poortvliet's succinct commentary and subtly hued illustrations add up to a history of hunting. He draws guns, snares, bows and arrows, traps, spears, and the people who use them just as meticulously as he draws the animals they depend on for food or must hunt for self-protection. He also chronicles changes in the Dutch landscape as he peels back the centuries and imagines life during the last Ice Age, when his ancestors bravely stalked woolly mammoths and rhinoceroses. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Queen&#39;s Conjurer: The Science and Magic of Dr. John Dee, Advisor to Queen Elizabeth I</h2><p>A fascinating portrait of one of the most brilliant, complex, and colorful figures of the Renaissance.<br><br>Although his accomplishments were substantial -- he became a trusted confidante to Queen Elizabeth I, inspired the formation of the British Empire, and plotted voyages to the New World-John Dee's story has been largely lost to history. Beyond the political sphere his intellectual pursuits ranged from the scientific to the occult. His mathematics anticipated Isaac Newton by nearly a century, while his mapmaking and navigation were critical to exploration. He was also obsessed with alchemy, astrology, and mysticism. His library was one of the finest in Europe, a vast compendium of thousands of volumes. Yet, despite his powerful position and prodigious intellect, Dee died in poverty and obscurity, reviled and pitied as a madman. <br><br>Benjamin Woolley tells the engrossing story of the rise and fall of this remarkable man, who wielded great influence during the pivotal era when the age of superstition collided with the new world of science and reason. Written with flair and vigor, based on numerous surviving diaries of the period, The Queen's Conjurer is a highly readable account of an extraordinary life.<br></p><p>Benjamin Woolley, a writer and broadcaster, covers both the arts and the sciences. His previous books include Virtual Worlds, an exploration of virtual reality, and The Bride of Science, a biography of Byron's brilliant daughter. He lives in London.<br>British broadcaster and writer Woolley's (The Bride of Science) biography of John Dee is an enchanting look into the world of science, magic, politics, and religion of 16th-century England. Dee plotted navigational charts for exploration of the New World and even presented a master plan to Queen Elizabeth on how to build an empire based on naval power. In the scientific world, Dee is probably best known for his mathematics and his amazing library, which contained nearly every significant book of the time and many titles whose significance would not be discovered for years to come. Dee, and particularly his deep involvement in magic and mystery, has been studied on and off over the years. The most notable study is Frances Yates's Theatre of the World (1969. o.p.), in which Dee is presented as a the embodiment of the Renaissance. More recent works include Peter French's John Dee: The World of an Elizabethan Magus (1984. o.p.) and Deborah Harkness's John Dee's Conversations with Angels (Cambridge Univ., 1999). Woolley's book is not a scholarly text but a much-needed compilation and consolidation of current and past research, easily accessible to the average reader. Highly recommended. Eric D.

Far richer in information and more incisive than America at Home (Smolan and Erwitt), it also moves well beyond Rick Smolan's Day in the Life series. It is a distant cousin of Material World and Hungry Planet in content and style, but represents a blend of rigorous science and photography that none of these books can claim. Using archaeological approaches to human material culture, this volume offers unprecedented access to the middle-class American home through the kaleidoscopic lens of no-limits photography and many kinds of never-before acquired data about how people actually live their lives at home.&nbsp;Based on a rigorous, nine-year project at UCLA, this book has appeal not only to scientists but also to all people who share intense curiosity about what goes on at home in their neighborhoods. Many who read the book will see their own lives mirrored in these pages and can reflect on how other people cope with their mountains of possessions and other daily challenges. Readers abroad will be equally fascinated by the contrasts between their own kinds of materialism and the typical American experience. The book will interest a range of designers, builders, and architects as well as scholars and students who research various facets of U.S. and global consumerism, cultural history, and economic history.</p><p><b>Published July 2012.&nbsp;</b><b>Second printing October 2012. </b><b><i>Winner of the 2012 JoAnne Stolaroff Cotsen Prize.</i></b> <b><i></i></b>Winner of the Jo Anne Stolaroff Cotsen Prize - 2012.Contemporary family life in America has been examined from many perspectives but rarely through the lens of household material culture--the things we own and the ways we use our homes.

Below fourteen thousand feet, giant gaping chasms bisect each other in chaotic patterns, but snowfall blows across the openings and freezes, so that deep crevasses are hidden from sight by a snow cover of only a few inches in places.</p><p>On a past training climb, I had made the mistake of bragging to my teammates that I could sense when we were over a hidden crevasse by the soft tremulous feel of the snow and the slightly hollow thunk made by my boot steps. So, they had decided to test my claim by pushing me forward and making me lead across the notoriously suspect snowfield below our fourteen-thousand-foot camp.</p><p>&#x201c;This&#x2019;ll teach you to brag, Super Blind Guy,&#x201d; Jeff, a close friend and one of my teammates, called out as he and the others crept along behind, keeping taut the 150-foot climbing rope connecting us. The tension in the rope assured me they would be ready to hurl their bodies face-first into the snow, their chests driving in the pick of their axes, hopefully arresting me, if I were to plunge through. The dry bitter wind roared across the surface of the glacier, rattling through my Gore-Tex. The wind scoured the top layer of snow into a frozen crust, and I could hear the biting metal squeak of my crampons as they clawed into the ice.</p><p>I stepped cautiously, listening as I slowly brought down the full weight of each step, forcing myself to breathe in rhythm. What were the chances of me stumbling upon a hidden crevasse, I thought, in this place, at this moment? I probed a trekking pole in front of me. Initially, it held, but suddenly it popped through the Styrofoam snow into emptiness, with me swooning forward, the pole sliding through to the handle. Then I heard it, the terrifying noise that climbers dread, the slit of a knife across the glacier and increasing to a loud zipper. I had heard this noise before, the sound of ice fracturing, breaking apart and zigzagging across the frozen ground, but I had never been so near. The snow around me collapsed with a <i>whoomp</i>. The muscles in my legs turned to putty and the rope stretched tighter as the team braced. I felt the lurch of my body and the snow beneath me dropping away, and I knew at once I had broken through. I could feel the air all around me, filling the space under my feet, along my legs, and against my face. Jeff yelled something, but his voice quickly faded in the rushing snow and gear that came with me. A moment later, I was confused because I was still standing. &#x201c;It was a false shelf! You only dropped a few feet,&#x201d; Chris, our leader, yelled urgently.</p><p>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing standing there, waiting for it to collapse again?&#x201d;</p><p>I forced my legs to move, mumbling, &#x201c;False shelves! I never said I could feel false shelves.&#x201d; The lower shelf I moved across was softer than the first, sagging and creaking below me. I tried not to think of the bottomless cavern beneath the thin bridge. I climbed a jagged little ice hump, swinging my ax above it, biting in and pulling myself over what I assumed was the fracture line, and breathed out deeply, chuckling grimly because I knew everyone else now had to cross.</p><p>Later at our fourteen-thousand-foot camp, Sam, my primary training partner, said he could finally see the brilliant white ramparts of the West Buttress leading to the top of Mount McKinley, a mile and a half above us. It had taken us a week to get here, but besides the crevasse danger, it had only been a grueling slog up moderate snow slopes. Tomorrow, the real climbing would begin. Sam took my finger and brought it up the route we would climb, stopping at prominent landmarks like the sixty-degree headwall, Washburn&#x2019;s Thumb, and Pig Hill. He pointed out the second tallest peak, Mount Foraker. Then, I tried to point toward McKinley&#x2019;s summit. I pointed my finger a little higher than Foraker. &#x201c;No. Higher!&#x201d; Sam laughed. I raised my finger. &#x201c;Still higher.&#x201d; I continued to point higher and higher. Finally, I pointed so high, I imagined I was pointing at the sun. &#x201c;There!&#x201d; Sam said, his voice softer and deeper now, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the summit of McKinley!&#x201d; That is when I felt the stubborn fear washing over me, beginning in the pit of my belly and slowly seeping into my fingertips, making them tingle.</p><p>All my life, fear had nearly paralyzed me. Rock climbing outside of Phoenix had definitely provided a healthy dose of fear, my one hand palming a precarious finger lock while my other hand scanned across the rock face, desperately searching for the next hold. For me, the fear of climbing blind does not come when I am hanging securely from a fat hold or after latching on to the next. The greatest fear is in the reaching, at that moment when I have committed my body and soul to finding the next hold, when I am hoping, predicting, praying I will find what I am seeking. But it isn&#x2019;t all fear. Despite the pain and frustration of going blind, the death of loved ones, the loss of my eyes to glaucoma, none of it had been enough to stamp out the hope. A delicate strand of hope balanced by fear, each keeping the other in its place. It was on the top of one of those rock faces when Sam suggested we try something a little bigger, &#x201c;Maybe Mount McKinley.&#x201d; I had immediately said yes, and the decision had been like another reach into the darkness, the greatest reach of my life.</p><p>That afternoon in the blazing heat, we built snow walls around our campsite. I knew about McKinley&#x2019;s legendary cold, but no one had told me about the heat, reflecting like a mirror off the snow and burning my eyeballs through the leather flaps of my glacier glasses. Then the wind, chilled by the glacier, whipped past me, taking much of my body&#x2019;s warmth with it. &#x201c;Windburn on top of sunburn. Get used to it,&#x201d; Chris laughed, observing Sam and me constructing snow fortresses out of the glacier. Sam cut blocks of blue ice from the floor while I placed them in a rectangle around the site to block the wind. Soon the walls were as tall as me. Then I cut steps into our fort while Sam packed the small gaps in the walls with snow. Finally the site was ready for the tent. I held one side and threw the other into the wind, which caught it and unfurled it. I laid it on the ground and oriented it by feeling the loops and pockets on the corners through my layers of gloves.</p><p>Months before on a training climb on Mount Rainier, a teammate assigned me to set up a tent on the Muir snowfield, on which wind and cold seemed to be the only constants. I was beginning to shiver as I knelt in the snow with the tent laid out in front of me. Through my thick gloves I couldn&#x2019;t feel the delicate sleeves of the fabric. I fumbled with it, clumsily trying to jam the pole through. Then I took my glove off so I could actually touch it. My hands were my eyes, but three frustrating layers of material over them made me feel blind. Only for a second, I thought. Just enough time to get the pole started in the sleeve. But sharp splinters of sleet pricked my bare skin and it went instantly numb. I stuffed my lifeless hand back inside the glove and beat it against my knee. When it came back to life, the pain was so intense I almost vomited from nausea. Not wanting to give up, I whipped off the other glove, but this hand too went numb before it even touched the tent fabric. Sam and Jeff approached. They had finished with the other tents and without saying a word started working on mine. The pain in my hands was nothing compared with my frustration and embarrassment, like a balloon expanding in my chest. I knelt in the snow, listening to the tent lifting up under the pressure of the poles, and I made a promise to myself. The things I could not do, I would let go; but the things I could do, I would learn to do well.</p><p>Afterwards in Phoenix, when the temperature was hovering above a hundred degrees, I took the tent to a field near the school where I taught and, with my thick gloves on, worked on setting it up and breaking it down and setting it up again. I heard cars slowing down on the nearby road, to gape, I imagined, at the lunatic in the blazing heat, in a tank top and mountaineering gloves, kneeling over a tent. But I refused to be the weak link of the team. I wanted them to put their lives in my hands, as I would put mine in theirs. I would carry my share. I would contribute as any other team member. I would not be carried up the mountain and spiked on top like a football. If I were to reach the summit, I would reach it with dignity.</p><p>That evening on McKinley, we sat on ice benches around the tents we&#x2019;d set up and our gas stove. I could feel the sun quickly dropping away beneath the peaks, plunging the temperature fifty degrees in minutes. Near eight P.M., climbers all over the mountain awaited Base Camp Annie&#x2019;s weather report over the two-way radio. Instead of the report, however, our radio crackled the news of two Taiwanese climbers who were trapped at nineteen thousand feet. That morning, they had left for the summit with high expectations but had pushed too hard and too fast in a whiteout and were forced to bivy on the Football Field, a hundred-yard shelf of snow just beneath the summit ridge. Now, many hours later, they lay huddled together, freezing to death in the frigid night air. One of them croaked their position to a rescue party. &#x201c;Sit tight,&#x201d; a ranger responded. &#x201c;The winds are too high for the Black Hawk.&#x201d; We all sat transfixed, drawn to the desperate events unfolding. An hour later, the same voice, although weaker, crackled over the radio. It was almost a whisper. &#x201c;My friend, he has stopped breathing.&#x201d;</p><p>Sam and I headed dejectedly for our tent. Sitting inside, Sam asked, &#x201c;What separates us from them? I mean from the guys who die?&#x201d; Neither of us spoke for a long time.</p><p>A year before, we had been no different. Sam and I, in preparation for McKinley, had tried to climb Humphrey&#x2019;s Peak in Arizona, a moderate climb that takes the average hiker only a few hours to summit. But minutes from the parking lot, Sam had hesitated. &#x201c;What if you get hurt up there?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;How would I get you down?&#x201d; I had only added to his doubts by leaving a glove in the car. Sam had gone ballistic, seizing the opportunity to reassess our prospects. &#x201c;If this had been McKinley,&#x201d; he said angrily, &#x201c;that might have meant your hand.&#x201d; So we had turned back, and I fumed with anger. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; he tried again. &#x201c;When we get up there, I&#x2019;m the one who has to get us down.&#x201d; And I understood that Sam was not so much questioning me, but his own ability to lead a blind person safely through the mountains.</p><p>A week later, when our tempers had cooled, Sam suggested that we try again, this time on Long&#x2019;s Peak, a rough fourteener in the Colorado Rockies. Gauging from our failure on Humphrey&#x2019;s, I didn&#x2019;t think we had any chance of succeeding on a much higher and more difficult peak, one often considered the most grueling in Colorado. And on top of everything, we would be trying it in January. I agreed anyway. On the first day we climbed slowly as I followed the sound of Sam&#x2019;s footsteps over icy boulder fields and up steep snow ridges. We were stopped five hundred feet from the summit by high winds. Retreating back to our high camp, we spent a traumatic night feeling the winds buffeting the tent walls...</p></p><h2>Rise the Dark</h2><p><b>Mark Novak's greatest mystery may be his own...</b><br><i>Rise the dark. </i>These were the last words written in Lauren Novak's notebook before she was murdered in a strange Florida village.

Reissue.</p><p>One feels for Betsy Lerner's writers. Oh, sure, Lerner must be a fabulous agent. But too bad for them: In gaining her as an agent, they lost her as an editor. How rare and wonderful it must have been to have such an advocate, advisor, and, yes, admirer so firmly ensconced in publisher territory (at various times, Houghton Mifflin, Ballantine, Simon &amp; Schuster, and Doubleday). In <i>The Forest for the Trees</i>, Lerner reflects on writing and publishing from an editor's point of view. There are so many books by writers and agents promising to disclose what editors really want; here, finally, is one straight from the source. Like all experienced editors, Lerner has seen writers at their best, and at their worst. "Like shrinks," she says, editors "have a privileged and exclusive view into a writer's psyche, from the ecstasy of acquisition to the agony of the remainder table."<p> To writers, particularly unpublished ones, editors can seem imposing figures determined to thwart their success. They won't take calls, they don't offer feedback--sometimes they don't respond to queries at all. Guess what: Editors don't lug home hundreds of pounds of manuscripts to read each year because they aren't looking for good writing. "An editor gets off," says Lerner, "on the thrill of discovering a new writer." Editors crave "succinct, well-written cover letters," inspiration that comes from within (as opposed to from the bestseller list), and "catchy, clearly targeted title[s]." They detest unsolicited phone calls, "query letters that sound as if they were penned by Crazy Eddie," and writers who offer to "write it however I want it" (it's "like saying I'll be straight or gay; you tell me, I have no preference"). Lerner is aware of how excruciating it is for a writer to wait for feedback on his or her work. But she also lets writers in on a little secret of her own. "I'm always anxious about the author's response," she confides. "Will he or she take to my editing?" <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>Betsy Lerner has worked as an editor at Houghton Mifflin, Ballantine, Simon &amp; Schuster, and was most recently executive editor at Doubleday.

Karnazes captures the euphoria and out-of-body highs of these adventures.</p><p>With an insight and candor rarely seen in sports memoirs, he also reveals how he merges the solitary, manic, self-absorbed life of hard-core ultrarunning with a full-time job, a wife, and two children, and how running has made him who he is today: a man with an �berjock's body, a teenager's energy, and a champion's wisdom.</p><p> </p><p></p></p><p>Ultra-marathoner Dean Karnazes claims "There is magic in misery." While it would be easy to write off his habit of running for 100 miles at a time&#x2014;or longer&#x2014;as mere masochism, it's impossible to not admire his tenacity in pushing his body to reach one extreme goal after another. Sure, it's gory to read about how he lost one of his big toenails from shoe friction during the Western States Endurance Run. But what registers more is that here's a guy competing in an event that includes 38,000 feet of elevation change--the equivalent of scaling the Empire State Building 30 times. <p> Despite his considerable athleticism, "Karno" argues that the first half of any race is run with one's body, and the second half with the mind. Without delving into excessively touchy-feely territory, he explores "the possibilities of self" as he completes an ultra-marathon in 120-degree heat in Death Valley, and later the first-ever marathon at the South Pole. It's an odd combination: a California surfer dude contemplating how, as Socrates said, "Suffering leads to wisdom." But Karnazes's self-motivation is utterly intriguing, and it's impossible to read this memoir without wanting to go out and run a marathon yourself.--<i>Erica Jorgensen</i></p>Dean Karnazes, who was named one of the Top 10 Ultimate Athletes by <b>Outside</b> magazine, is president of EnergyWell Natural Foods in San Francisco.</p><h2>Big Money</h2><p>LORD BISKERTON, son and heir of the sixth Earl of Hoddesdon, and known to his friends as Biscuit, had red hair, a preliminary scenario for a moustache and a noble determination to escape the disgrace of work. His friend Berry Conway, however, had succumbed to economic pressure and become the secretary to T. Paterson Frisby, a dyspeptic American who had twenty million and loved every cent of it. When Biscuit and Berry pooled ideas for their mutual betterment, and one idea concerned Ann Moon, Frisby&#39;s beautiful niece and heiress, they had to lean heavily on Aunt Vera, an old campaigner in the field of love.

Again and again, she&#x2019;d lain there in the dark, covered in cold sweat and waiting for her heart to slow, relieved that Emma, lying beside her, hadn&#x2019;t woken, relieved that it had only been a dream.<br><br> Except it wasn&#x2019;t a dream; she knew that.<br><br> He&#x2019;ll come, Kate repeated. When he reads it, he&#x2019;ll come.<br><br> The day was hot and humid, and Kate wore a lightweight summer dress and a pair of patched leather sandals. Her hair was pulled back and cinched with a rubber band, though a few loose strands stuck to her face and neck. She was fifteen and taller than she&#x2019;d been a year ago. In other respects, her appearance hadn&#x2019;t changed. With her dark blond hair and hazel eyes, she still struck all who saw her as a remarkably pretty girl. But a person did not have to look closely to see the furrow of worry that was etched into her brow, or the tension that lived in her arms and shoulders, or the way her fingernails were bitten to the quick.<br><br> In that respect, truly, nothing had changed.<br><br> Kate had not moved from beside the tree, but stood there, absently fingering the gold locket that hung from her neck.<br><br> More than ten years earlier, Kate and her younger brother and sister had been sent away from their parents. They had grown up in a series of orphanages, a few that were nice and clean, run by kind men and women, but most of them not so nice, and the adults who ran them not so kind. The children had not been told why their parents had sent them away, or when they were coming back. But that their parents would eventually return, that they would all once more be a family, the children had never doubted.<br><br> It had been Kate&#x2019;s duty to look after her brother and sister. She had made that promise the night her mother had come into her room that Christmas Eve so long ago. She could picture it still: her mother leaning over her, fastening the golden locket around her small neck, as Kate promised that she would protect Michael and Emma and keep them safe.<br><br> And year after year, in orphanage after orphanage, even when they had faced dangers and enemies they could never have imagined, Kate had been true to her word.<br><br> But if Dr. Pym didn&#x2019;t come, how would she protect them now?<br><br> But he will come, she told herself. He hasn&#x2019;t abandoned us.<br><br> If that&#x2019;s so, said a voice in her head, why did he send you here?<br><br> And, unable to help herself, Kate turned and looked down the hill. There, visible through the trees, were the crumbling brick walls and turrets of the Edgar Allan Poe Home for Hopeless and Incorrigible Orphans.<br><br> In her defense, it was only when Kate was frustrated or tired that she questioned Dr. Pym&#x2019;s decision to send her and Michael and Emma back to Baltimore. She knew he hadn&#x2019;t really abandoned them. But the fact remained: of all the orphanages the children had lived in over the years--one of which had been next to a sewage treatment plant; another had made groaning noises and seemed to be always catching on fire--the Edgar Allan Poe Home for Hopeless and Incorrigible Orphans was the worst. The rooms were freezing in the winter, boiling in the summer; the water was brown and chunky; the floors squished and oozed; the ceilings leaked; it was home to warring gangs of feral cats. . . .<br><br> And as if that weren&#x2019;t enough, there was Miss Crumley, the lumpy-bodied, Kate-and-her-brother-and-sister-hating orphanage director. Miss Crumley had thought she&#x2019;d gotten rid of the children for good last Christmas, and she had been less than pleased to have them turn up on her doorstep a week later, bearing a note from Dr. Pym saying that the orphanage at Cambridge Falls had been closed due to &#x201c;an infestation of turtles,&#x201d; and would Miss Crumley mind watching the children till the problem was resolved.<br><br> Of course Miss Crumley had minded. But when she&#x2019;d attempted to call Dr. Pym to inform him that under no circumstances could she accept the children and that she was returning them on the next train, she&#x2019;d found that all the information Dr. Pym had previously given her (phone number for the orphanage, address and directions, testimonials from happy, well-fed children) had disappeared from her files. Nor did the phone company have any record of a number. In fact, no matter how much she dug, Miss Crumley was unable to find any evidence that the town of Cambridge Falls actually existed. In the end, she&#x2019;d been forced to give in. But she let the children know that they were unwelcome, and she took every opportunity to corner them in the hallways or the cafeteria, firing questions while poking them with her pudgy finger.<br><br> &#x201c;Where exactly is this Cambridge Falls?&#x201d;--poke--&#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t I find it on any maps?&#x201d;--poke--&#x201c;Who is this Dr. Pym fellow?&#x201d;--poke, poke--&#x201c;Is he even a real doctor?&#x201d;--poke, poke, poke--&#x201c;What happened up there? I know something fishy&#x2019;s going on! Answer me!&#x201d;--poke, poke, poke, pinch, twist.<br><br> Frustrated at having had her hair pulled for the third time in one week, Emma had suggested that they tell Miss Crumley the truth: that Dr. Stanislaus Pym was a wizard, that the reason Miss Crumley couldn&#x2019;t find Cambridge Falls on a map was that it was part of the magical world and therefore hidden from normal (or in her case, subnormal) humans, that as far as what had happened there, the three of them had discovered an old book bound in green leather that had carried them back through time, that they&#x2019;d met dwarves and monsters, fought an evil witch, saved an entire town, and that pretty much any way you looked at it, they were heroes. Even Michael.<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Michael had said sarcastically.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Anyway, we can&#x2019;t say that. She&#x2019;ll think we&#x2019;re crazy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So what?&#x201d; Emma had replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather be in a loony bin than this place.&#x201d;<br><br> But in the end, Kate had made them stick to their story. Cambridge Falls was an ordinary sort of place, Dr. Pym was an ordinary sort of man, and nothing the least bit out of the ordinary had happened. &#x201c;We have to trust Dr. Pym.&#x201d;<br><br> After all, Kate thought, what other choice did they have?</p><h2>A Dictionary of Freemasonry</h2><p>Here is a remarkable history, encyclopedia and symbolic dictionary of Freemasonry all in one convenient volume and attractively illustrated with 300 nineteenth-century engravings.<br><br>The 600-year-old brotherhood of Freemasons (based on a 3,000-year-old tradition) is one of the most widely known fraternal organizations in the world. Robert Macoy compiled this work in order to present comprehensive information on Freemasonry in an accessible form.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the full resources of the Fraternity available to him, Macoy sought to sort out the truth from a myriad of half truths, rumors, superstitions and interpretations. He presents the rise and problems of Freemasonry and its kindred association both ancient and modern. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "General History of Freemasonry," which begins this volume, is a fascinating introduction to a very complicated subject often fraught with vagaries. The two A-to-Z reference works that follow--one an encyclopedia with listings of terms, people, places, and events that make up the extensive history of the Freemasons, and the other a dictionary of symbols--contribute to making this a very complete sourcebook on Freemasonry.<br><br>From Aaron, the Abelites, and the All-Seeing Eye to the Year of Masonry, Zenith, and the Rite of Zinnendorf, this is a remarkable book on a subject that runs through the course of human history.</p><p>about the author: Robert Macoy 33� (1815-1895), author of The Book of the Lodge, and True Masonic Guide, was Past Deputy Grand Master of New York and Nova Scotia, Past Grand Secretary of New York, Grand Recorder of the Grand Commandery of New York.

He taught humanities for twenty-six years in various colleges and universities before becoming a Jungian Analyst at the Jung Institute in Zurich, Switzerland, where he received a diploma in Analytical Psychology. He has a private analytic practice and is Executive Director of the Jung Educational Center of Houston.Jungian psychologist Hollis turns the whole why-bad-things-happen-to-good-people question around and asks, instead, why good people often do such horrible things. Exploring the notion of the Shadow, Jung's term to describe the hidden aspects of ourselves--the parts that contradict the self we show the rest of the world, the dark side of our personality--Hollis suggests that we can only become whole (and good) by acknowledging our Shadow and accepting that it's OK to have a dark side, as long as we never let it take control of who we are. The prose is a little stodgy, and some readers might find the book feels a little too similar to others in the psychological self-help genre, but finally the similarities are only superficial. The difference between this book and most of the slick self-helpers is that Hollis has some genuinely important, meaningful things to say. A thoughtful book, well worth the concentration involved in reading it. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Numerous theories have sprouted in an attempt to console ourselves and to point the blame in emotionally satisfying directions&#x2015;yet none of them are fully convincing. As witnesses to the Holocaust near the ends of their lives, it becomes that much more important to unravel what happened and to educate a new generation about the horrors inflicted by the Nazi regime on Jews and non-Jews alike.</p><p><em>Why?</em> dispels many misconceptions and answers some of the most basic&#x2015;yet vexing&#x2015;questions that remain: why the Jews and not another ethnic group? Why the Germans? Why such a swift and sweeping extermination? Why didn&#x2019;t more Jews fight back more often? Why didn&#x2019;t they receive more help? While responding to the questions he has been most frequently asked by students over the decades, world-renowned Holocaust historian and professor Peter Hayes brings a wealth of scholarly research and experience to bear on conventional, popular views of the history, challenging some of the most prominent recent interpretations. He argues that there is no single theory that &#x201c;explains&#x201d; the Holocaust; the convergence of multiple forces at a particular moment in time led to catastrophe.</p><p>In clear prose informed by an encyclopedic knowledge of Holocaust literature in English and German, Hayes weaves together stories and statistics to heart-stopping effect. <em>Why?</em> is an authoritative, groundbreaking exploration of the origins of one of the most tragic events in human history.</p> 5 illustrations</p><p><strong>Peter Hayes</strong> is professor of history and German and Theodore Zev Weiss Holocaust Educational Foundation Professor of Holocaust Studies Emeritus at Northwestern University, and chair of the Academic Committee of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.&#x201c;This clearly written, cogently argued and researched book....courageously confronts some of the thorniest issues raised by the Shoah, making <em>Why?: Explaining the Holocaust</em> an indispensable work for specialists and informed readers alike.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael N.

His many conclusions include the awesome&#x2015;for better or worse&#x2015;power of individual agency: No Hitler, no Holocaust. But Hitler began tentatively, with small measures.

Unlike most works on the history of the Holocaust....Hayes&#x2019; book concentrates....on helping readers to understand why the Holocaust occurred when it did, in the manner it did and with the results it produced.

Why did such a thing happen? Taking up this most difficult of challenges, his pages answer questions that many analysts dare not even ask, let alone answer. That is why this work should be required reading, both for specialists and for those who seek more recently to understand.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael R.

Beyond the basic description, the author includes insight into the culture, natural materials, and societal influences that led to the diversity of costumes.

But the discovery of the bodies of nine illegal aliens, machine-gunned to death and buried in a shallow grave behind a church, soon makes it clear that he won't escape so easily.<p>As Hack and Deputy Sheriff Pam Tibbs attempt to untangle the threads of this complex and grisly case, a damaged young Iraq veteran, Pete Flores, and his girlfriend, Vikki Gaddis, are running for their lives, hoping to outwit the bloodthirsty criminals who want to kill Pete for his involvement in the murders. The only trouble is, Pete doesn't know who he's running from: drunk and terrified, he fled the scene of the crime when the shooting began. And there's a long list of people who want Pete and Vikki dead: crime boss Hugo Cistranos, who hired Pete for the operation; Nick Dolan, a strip club owner and small-time gangster with revenge on his mind; and a mysterious God-fearing serial-killer-for-hire known as Preacher Jack Collins, with enigmatic motives of his own.</p><p>With the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and a host of cold-blooded killers on Pete and Vikki's trail, it's up to Sheriff Holland to find them first and figure out who's behind the mass murder before anyone else ends up dead.

Next to the filling station was a mechanic&#x2019;s shed whose desiccated boards lay collapsed upon a rusted pickup truck with four flat bald tires. At the intersection a stoplight hung from a horizontal cable strung between two power poles, its plastic covers shot out by .22 rifles.<br> <br>The young man entered a phone booth and wiped his face slick with the flat of his hand. His denim shirt was stiff with salt and open on his chest, his hair mowed into the scalp, GI-style. He pulled an unlabeled pint bottle from the front of his jeans and unscrewed the cap. Down the right side of his face was a swollen pink scar that was as bright and shiny as plastic and looked pasted onto the skin rather than part of it. The mescal in the bottle was yellow and thick with threadworms that seemed to light against the sunset when he tipped the neck to his mouth. Inside the booth, he could feel his heart quickening and lines of sweat running down from his armpits into the waistband of his undershorts.

There&#x2019;s oceans of trash down by the border. Dirty diapers and moldy clothes and rotted food and tennis shoes without strings in them. Why would they take the strings out of their tennis shoes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this about illegals?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I said I heard somebody busting caps. That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;m reporting. Maybe I heard a tailgate drop. I&#x2019;m sure I did. It clanked in the dark.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, where are you calling from?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The same place I heard all that shooting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Give me your name, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What name they got for a guy so dumb he thinks doing the right thing is the right thing? Answer me that, please, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br> <br>He tried to slam down the receiver on the hook but missed. The phone receiver swung back and forth from the phone box as the young man with the welted pink scar on his face drove away, road dust sucking back through the glassless windows of his car.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>TWENTY-FOUR HOURS LATER, at sunset, the sky turned to turquoise; then the strips of black cloud along the horizon were backlit by a red brilliance that was like the glow of a forge, as though the cooling of the day were about to be set into abeyance so the sun&#x2019;s heat could prevail through the night into the following dawn. Across the street from the abandoned filling station, a tall man in his seventies, wearing western-cut khakis and hand-tooled boots and an old-fashioned gun belt and a dove-colored Stetson, parked his truck in front of what appeared to be the shell of a Spanish mission. The roof had caved onto the floor, and the doors had been twisted off the hinges and carried inside and broken up and used for firewood by homeless people or teenage vandals. The only tree in the crossroads community was a giant willow; it shaded one side of the church and created a strange effect of shadow and red light on the stucco walls, as though a grass fire were approaching the structure and about to consume it.<br> <br>In reality, the church had been built not by Spaniards or Mexicans but by an industrialist who had become the most hated man in America after his company security forces and members of the Colorado militia massacred eleven children and two women during a miners&#x2019; strike in 1914. Later, the industrialist reinvented himself as a philanthropist and humanitarian and rehabilitated his family name by building churches around the country. But the miners did not get their union, and this particular church became a scorched cipher that few associate with the two women and eleven children who had tried to hide in a root cellar while the canvas tent above them rained ash and flame upon their heads.<br> <br>The tall man was wearing a holstered blue-black white-handled revolver. Unconsciously, he removed his hat when he entered the church, waiting for his eyes to adjust to the deep shadows inside the walls. The oak flooring had been ripped up and hauled away by a contractor, and the dirt underneath was green and cool with lack of sunlight, packed down hard, humped in places, smelling of dampness and the feces of field mice. Scattered about the church&#x2019;s interior, glinting like gold teeth, were dozens of brass shell casings.<br> <br>The tall man squatted down, his gunbelt creaking, his knees popping. He picked up a casing on the end of a ballpoint pen. It, like all the others, was .45-caliber. He cleared his throat softly and spat to one side, unable to avoid the odor that the wind had just kicked up outside. He rose to his feet and walked out the back door and gazed at a field that had been raked by a bulldozer&#x2019;s blade, the cinnamon-colored dirt scrolled and stenciled by the dozer&#x2019;s steel treads.<br> <br>The tall man returned to his pickup truck and removed a leaf rake and a long-handled shovel from the bed. He walked into the field and sank the steel tip of the shovel blade with the weight of his leg and haunch and struck a rock, then reset the blade in a different spot and tried again. This time the blade went deep, all the way up to his boot sole, as though it were cutting through compacted coffee grounds rather than dirt. When he pulled the shovel free, an odor rose into his nostrils that made his throat close against the bilious surge in his stomach. He soaked a bandana from a canteen in his truck and wrapped it around the lower half of his face and knotted it behind his head. Then he walked slowly across the field, jabbing the inverted half of the rake handle into the ground. Every three or four feet, at the same depth, he felt a soft form of resistance, like a sack of feed whose burlap has rotted and split, the dry dirt rilling back into the hole each time he pulled the wood shaft from the surface. The breeze had died completely. The air was green with the sun&#x2019;s last light, the sky dissected by birds, the air stained by a growing stench that seemed to rise from his boots into his clothes. The tall man inverted the rake, careful not to touch the tip that he had pushed below the soil, and began scraping at a depression that a feral animal had already crosshatched with claw marks.<br> <br>The tall man had many memories from his early life that he seldom shared with others. They involved images of snowy hills south of the Yalu River, and dead Chinese troops in quilted uniforms scattered randomly across the slopes, and F-80 jets flying low out of the overcast sky, strafing the perimeter to push the Chinese mortar and automatic weapons teams back out of range. The wounds on the American dead piled in the backs of the six-bys looked like roses frozen inside snow.<br> <br>In his sleep, the tall man still heard bugles blowing in the hills, echoing as coldly as brass ringing on stone.<br> <br>The spidery tines of the rake pulled a lock of black hair free from the dirt. The tall man, whose name was Hackberry Holland, looked down into the depression. He touched the rake at the edges of the rounded shape he had uncovered. Then, because of either a lack of compaction around the figure or the fact that it lay on top of other bodies, the soil began to slide off the person&#x2019;s face and ears and neck and shoulders, down into a subterranean hole, exposing the waxy opalescence of a brow, the rictus that imitated surprise, one eye lidded, the other as bold as a child&#x2019;s marble, a ball of dirt clenched in the figure&#x2019;s palm.<br> <br>She was thin-boned, a toy person, her black blouse a receptacle for heat and totally inappropriate for the climate. He guessed she was not over seventeen and that she had been alive when the dirt was pushed on top of her. She was also Asian, not Hispanic as he had expected.<br> <br>For the next half hour, until the light had gone from the sky, he continued to rake and dig in the field that had obviously been scraped down to the hardpan by a dozer blade, then backfilled with the overburden and tamped down and graded as smoothly as if in preparation for construction of a home.<br> <br>He went back to his truck and threw the rake and shovel in the bed, then lifted his handheld radio off the passenger seat. &#x201c;Maydeen, this is Sheriff Holland,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m behind the old church at Chapala Crossing. I&#x2019;ve uncovered the burials of nine homicide victims so far, all female. Call the feds and also call both Brewster and Terrell counties and tell them we need their assistance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re breaking up. Say again? Did I read you right? You said nine homicide&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a mass murder. The victims are all Asian, some of them hardly more than children.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The guy who made the nine-one-one, he called a second time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d he say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he just happened by the church site. I think he&#x2019;s dripping with guilt.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you get his name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He said it was Pete. No last name. Why didn&#x2019;t you call in? I could have sent help. You&#x2019;re too goddamn old for this crap, Hack.&#x201d;<br> <br>Because at a certain age, you finally accept and trust yourself and let go of the world, he thought. But in reply, all he said was &#x201c;Maydeen, would you not use that kind of language over the air, please?&#x201d;<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>PETE FLORES NEVER quite understood why the girl lived with him. Her hair was chestnut-colored, cut short and curled on the ends, her skin clear, her blue-green eyes deep-set, which gave them a mysterious quality that intrigued men and caused them to stare at her back long after she had walked past them. At the diner where she worked, she conducted herself with a level of grace that her customers, mostly long-haul truckers, sensed and respected and were protective of. She attended classes three nights a week at a junior college in the county seat, and the previous semester had published a short story in the college literary magazine. Her name was Vikki Gaddis, and she played a big-belly J-200 Gibson that her father, a part-time country musician from Medicine Lodge, Kansas, had given her when she was twelve years old.<br> <br>Her husky voice and accent were not acquired or feigned. On occasion, when she played her guitar and sang at the diner, her customers rose from their chairs and stools and applauded. She also performed sometimes at the nightclub next door, although the patrons were unsure how they should respond when she sang &#x201c;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&#x201d; and &#x201c;Keep on the Sunny Side of Life.&#x201d;<br> <br>She was still asleep when Pete entered the paintless frame house they rented, one that sat inside the blue shadow of a hill when the sun rose above the horizon as hot and sultry as a broken egg yolk, the light streaking across the barren land. Pete&#x2019;s scalp and face were pulled tight with the beginnings of a hangover, the inside of his head still filled with the sounds of the highway bar he had been in. He washed his face in the sink, the water running cool out of a faucet that drew on an aluminum cistern elevated on stilts behind the house. The hill that blocked the sunrise, almost like an act of mercy, looked made of rust and cinders and was dotted with scrub brush and mesquite trees whose root systems could barely grow deep enough to find moisture. He knew Vikki would be up soon, that she had probably waited for him last night and slept fitfully, either knowing or not knowing where he was. He wanted to fix breakfast for her, as a form of contrition or in a pretense at normalcy. He filled the coffeepot with water, and the effect of both darkness and coolness it created inside the metal was somehow a temporary balm to the pounding heat inside his head.<br> <br>He smeared margarine inside a skillet and took two eggs and a piece of sliced ham from the ice chest he and Vikki used as a refrigerator. He broke the eggs in the skillet and set the ham and a slice of sourdough bread beside them and let the skillet begin to heat on the propane stove. The smell of the breakfast he wanted to cook for Vikki rose into his face, and he rushed out the back door into the yard so he would not retch on his clothes.<br> <br>He held on to the sides of a horse tank, his stomach empty now, his back shaking, a pressure band tightening across his scalp, his breath an insult to the air and the freshness of the morning. He thought he heard the thropping downdraft of gunships and the great clanking weight of an armored vehicle topping a rise, its treads dripping sand, a CD of Burn, Motherfucker, Burn screaming over the intercom. He stared into the distant wastes, but the only living things he saw were carrion birds floating high on the wind stream, turning in slow circles as the land heated and the smell of mortality rose into the sky.<br> <br>He went back inside and rinsed his mouth, then scraped Vikki&#x2019;s breakfast onto a plate. The eggs were burned on the edges, the yolks broken and hard and stained with black grease. He sat in a chair and hung his head between his knees, the kitchen spinning around him. Through the partially opened door of the bedroom, through the blue light and the dust stirring in the breeze, he could see her head on the pillow, her eyes closed, her lips parted with her breathing. The poverty of the surroundings into which he had taken her made him ashamed. The cracks in the linoleum were ingrained with dirt, the mismatched furniture bought at Goodwill, the walls a sickly green. Everything he touched except Vikki Gaddis was somehow an extension of his own failure.<br> <br>Her eyes opened. Pete sat up straight in the chair, trying to smile, his face stiff and unnatural with the effort.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was fixing you breakfast, but I made a mess of it,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where you been, hon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, up yonder,&#x201d; he replied, gesturing in the direction of the highway. He waited for her to speak, but she didn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Why would people throw away their tennis shoes but take the shoestrings with them?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In the places where the wets go through, there&#x2019;s trash and garbage everywhere. They throw away their old tennis shoes, but they take out the strings first. Why do they do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>She was standing up now, pulling her jeans over her panties, looking down at her fingers as she buttoned her jeans over the flatness of her stomach.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s &#x2019;cause they don&#x2019;t own much else, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; he said in answer to his own question. &#x201c;Them poor people don&#x2019;t own nothing but the word of the coyote that takes them across. That&#x2019;s a miserable fate for someone, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What have you got into, Pete?&#x201d;<br> <br>He knitted his fingers together between his thighs and squeezed t...</p><h2>A Frolic of His Own</h2><p>A satirically jaundiced view of modern law and justice chronicles the fortunes of Oscar Crease, a middle-aged college instructor and playwright, as he sues a Hollywood producer for pirating a play</p><p>Perhaps William Gaddis' most accessible novel--though a dense and imposing book--<i>A Frolic of His Own</i> is a masterful work that mocks the folly of a litigious society. The story centers around Oscar Crease, the grandson of a Confederate soldier who avoided a deadly battle by invoking a legal clause that allowed him to hire a substitute and who later became a Supreme Court judge. Oscar writes a play about his grandfather that goes unproduced yet appears as the story behind a big-budget Hollywood film. Oscar sues and is tossed into the vortex of litigation. Meanwhile, almost 20 other lawsuits of varying frivolity swirl about, adding to this satirical and philosophical treat, which won the National Book Award for 1994.Greed and its destruction of independent authenticity is Gaddis's best subject, and with it here he has essentially rewritten his masterpiece, JR (1975)--not so much with business as the focus (as in that earlier book) but with lawyers. A ne'er-do-well college instructor, Oscar Crease, has written a long, sludgy philosophical Civil War play that he once sent off desperately to a TV producer; years later, a Hollywood blockbuster movie seems to duplicate (though only in Crease's mind) some of the stuff in the play. Crease sues--plagiarism--and is promptly sucked down into wholesale legal disaster: depositions, bills, opinions, more bills, appeals, more bills, bills and bills. His half-sister Christina and her establishment law-firm partner husband try to steer him through--but everyone gets drowned in the tidal wave of litigiousness. Meanwhile, Crease's own elderly father, a federal judge, is, as a sidebar, a stereoscopic whack at the legal system, simultaneously ruling on a case involving a dog killed while stuck in a piece of public sculpture (the book's most mordantly funny set-piece). Here, like JR, the novel is one of voices that are remarkably faithful to the real patterns of speech--interrupted, trivial, saying most when no one else seems to be listening. Paragraphs of speeded-up narrative link the voices, which are also interspersed now and then with depositions and judicial opinions. Gaddis's paranoid comedy of skepticism (some of it fairly cheap: a director named Jonathan Livingston Siegel, a car company called Sosumi Motors) pushes relentlessly forward... ...but if you've read a quarter of the book, you've read the whole thing: clever and brilliant though it is, it feels like a massive imposition on your time. Gaddis seems to want to prove the novel capable of film's open mike and panning shots, music's structure, and opera's recitatives (everyone only screeches and beseeches)--but once he has, all that finally seems left is a rather tinny note of pissed-off energy and formal subordination. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Anything&#x2019;s possible at the Eat-A-Bug Cafe, otherwise known as the kitchen of naturalist David George Gordon, entomological epicure extraordinaire.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gordon has gone to the ends of the earth, to his backyard, and under the refrigerator to find culinary inspiration, and now, after years of experimentation with entomophagy (that&#x2019;s bug-eating, for those of you in the cheap seats), he presents the results with relish...or at least a light cream sauce.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now you too can tantalize and terrify your family and friends with Gordon&#x2019;s one-of-a-kind recipes, including Really Hoppin&#x2019; John (grasshoppers add that little extra kick), Pest-O (common garden weevils get their comeuppance in a delicate basil sauce) and Fried Green Tomato Hornworm (the Whistle Stop Cafe was never like this!)<br><br>Anecdotes, insights and culinary tips (such as the right wine to serve with scorpions) make this truly a book like no other.

Eat a bug.</p><p>David George Gordon, author of <i>The Compleat Cockroach</i>, says eating protein-rich bugs is good for you ("Crickets are loaded with calcium, and termites are rich in iron), and good for the earth ("Raising cows, pigs, and sheep is a tremendous waste of the planet's resources, but bug ranching is pretty benign"). After all, what's inherently more disgusting about eating a grasshopper than, say, an oyster? Gordon enthusiastically provides recipes for terrestrial arthropods gleaned from the entomophagic appetites of people around the world, telling you which insects are most delicious and which to avoid, how to cook them, and which wine to drink with your many-legged meal. The recipes themselves are clear, easy to follow, and quite educational, with sidebar tidbits about the bugs you're about to eat. Gordon divides the recipes into sections by type of insect, be it grasshoppers, social insects, or "pantry pests." And, of course, he provides a list of places where you can order your edible insects and tips for catching your own. <i>The Eat a Bug Cookbook</i> is a sure kitchen conversation piece--even if you never try Three Bee Salad or Chocolate Cricket Torte, you'll laugh out loud, squirm uncomfortably, and lick your chops while taking this deliciously creepy culinary tour. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>An award-winning nature writer, David George Gordon is the author of eleven guides to North American wildlife and wild places.</p><h2>The Small Backs of Children: A Novel</h2><p><p>National Bestseller</p><p>A masterful literary talent explores the treacherous, often violent borders between war and sex, love and art.</p><p><em>With the flash of a camera, one girl&#x2019;s life is shattered, and a host of others altered forever. . .</em></p><p>In a war-torn village in Eastern Europe, an American photographer captures a heart-stopping image: a young girl flying toward the lens, fleeing a fiery explosion that has engulfed her home and family.

But, Alex Bellos says, "math can be inspiring and brilliantly creative. Mathematical thought is one of the great achievements of the human race, and arguably the foundation of all human progress. The world of mathematics is a remarkable place."<br><br>Bellos has traveled all around the globe and has plunged into history to uncover fascinating stories of mathematical achievement, from the breakthroughs of Euclid, the greatest mathematician of all time, to the creations of the Zen master of origami, one of the hottest areas of mathematical work today. Taking us into the wilds of the Amazon, he tells the story of a tribe there who can count only to five and reports on the latest findings about the math instinct&#x2014;including the revelation that ants can actually count how many steps they&#x2019;ve taken. Journeying to the Bay of Bengal, he interviews a Hindu sage about the brilliant mathematical insights of the Buddha, while in Japan he visits the godfather of Sudoku and introduces the brainteasing delights of mathematical games.<br><br>Exploring the mysteries of randomness, he explains why it is impossible for our iPods to truly randomly select songs. In probing the many intrigues of that most beloved of numbers, pi, he visits with two brothers so obsessed with the elusive number that they built a supercomputer in their Manhattan apartment to study it. Throughout, the journey is enhanced with a wealth of intriguing illustrations, such as of the clever puzzles known as tangrams and the crochet creation of an American math professor who suddenly realized one day that she could knit a representation of higher dimensional space that no one had been able to visualize. <br><br>Whether writing about how algebra solved Swedish traffic problems, visiting the Mental Calculation World Cup to disclose the secrets of lightning calculation, or exploring the links between pineapples and beautiful teeth, Bellos is a wonderfully engaging guide who never fails to delight even as he edifies. <i>Here&#x2019;s Looking at Euclid </i>is a rare gem that brings the beauty of math to life.</p><p>At last, a math book for people who think they don't like math. Alex Bellos's self-proclaimed "Surprising Excursion Through the Astonishing World of Math" delivers on its promise. You'll meet the numerologist who persuaded Puff Daddy to change his name, a Romanian probability theorist who parlayed his know-how into enough lotteries wins to fund an early retirement in the South Pacific, and the nine-year-old Japanese prodigy who can play a speed-game in which two players quickly alternate saying a word that begins with the last word's last syllable while simultaneously summing 30 three-digits numbers--in <em>20 seconds!</em> You'll learn about tangrams, piems, hyperbolic crochet, nature's ubiquitous "golden ratio," the spooky dogma of the bell curve, why origami is on the bleeding edge of theoretical mathematics, how to make $250,000 in the search for ever-larger prime numbers, and how to gamble just a little bit less badly.

But when Isaacson, a lifelong horseman, rode their neighbor's horse with Rowan, Rowan improved immeasurably. He was struck with a crazy idea: why not take Rowan to Mongolia, the one place in the world where horses and shamanic healing intersected? <br><br>THE HORSE BOY is the dramatic and heartwarming story of that impossible adventure. In Mongolia, the family found undreamed of landscapes and people, unbearable setbacks, and advances beyond their wildest dreams. This is a deeply moving, truly one-of-a-kind story--of a family willing to go to the ends of the earth to help their son, and of a boy learning to connect with the world for the first time.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Temple Grandin Reviews <em>The Horse Boy:&nbsp; A Father's Quest to Heal His Son</em></strong><br><br> <strong>Drawing from her own experience with autism and her distinguished career as an animal scientist, Temple Grandin has provided readers with extraordinary insight into how animals think, act, and feel. Her books include <em>The Way I See It</em>, and the national bestsellers, <em>Thinking in Pictures</em>, <em>Animals in Translation</em>, and <em>Animals Make Us Human</em>. We were eager to hear what Grandin thought about Rupert Isaacson and his family's quest to go to the ends of the earth to help their son. Read her exclusive Amazon guest review to find out.</strong> <br> <p></p> <p>This is a fascinating book. It is the tale of a family's journey to Mongolia with their five-year-old son who has autism. The family travels to the northern remote areas and lives with the nomads and herders away from the cities. I loved the descriptions of the nomad way of life, and that they were so accepting of a child with autism. Rowan loved baby animals and the people did not mind when he grabbed a baby goat and climbed into one of their beds with it. During the trip, Rowan developed improved language and behavior. He also had a magical connection with horses. There are many wonderful passages about Rowan&#x2019;s exploits with a Mongolian horse named Blackie.</p> <p>Rupert Isaacson was surprised at how accommodating the Mongolian people were. They tolerated Rowan's pushing, yelping, and joyful rushing about. At the end of the book the family get a rude awakening when a German tourist who was a psychologist disapproved of bringing a child with autism to a national park to view wild horses. I was interviewed by Rupert Isaacson before he wrote his book and we discussed perhaps the shamans and the healers in some traditional cultures had autistic traits. Their rituals with rhythmic chanting and repetitive movements have similarities to autistic "stims." When I was little, I went into a calm trance-like state when I rocked and dribbled sand through my hands.</p> <p>Children with autism need to be exposed to lots of interesting things and new experiences in order to develop. One of the reasons the trip to Mongolia was so beneficial was that Rowan could explore lots of fascinating things such as horses, streams, plants, and animals in an environment that was QUIET. The Mongolian pastureland was a quiet environment free of the things that overload the sensory system of a child with autism. There were no florescent lights or constant noise and echoes. Some individuals with autism see the flicker of florescent lights which is like being in a disco with strobe lights. When I was a child, loud sounds hurt my ears.</p> <p>Parents and teachers can duplicate the benefits of this trip without having to travel. Horseback riding is a great activity. Many parents have told me that their child spoke his/her first words on a horse. Activities that combine both rhythm and balancing such as horseback riding, sitting on a ball, or swinging help stabilize a disordered sensory system. There are lots of places you can take a child to explore nature such as parks, brooks or a field with tall grass. Children with autism need to be shown interesting things and encouraged to do new things. Everywhere Rowan went he was asked questions and encouraged to talk about the things he was looking at. You need to find QUIET, interesting places away from crowds of people, florescent lights, traffic, and noise, where you can engage the child and keep him tuned in. This is a great book and everyone who is interested in autism, animals or different cultures should read it. <em>--Temple Grandin</em></p>Rupert Isaacson was born in London to a South African mother and a Zimbabwean father.

Retired now, he still wakes early and remembers how mornings used to be his favorite, as though the world were his secret, tires rumbling softly beneath him and the light emerging through the early fog, the brief sight of the bay off to his right, then the pines, tall and slender, and almost always he rode with the window partly open because he loved the smell of the pines and the heavy salt air, and in the winter he loved the smell of the cold. The pharmacy was a small two-story building attached to another building that housed separately a hardware store and a small grocery. Each morning Henry parked in the back by the large metal bins, and then entered the pharmacy&#x2019;s back door, and went about switching on the lights, turning up the thermostat, or, if it was summer, getting the fans going. He would open the safe, put money in the register, unlock the front door, wash his hands, put on his white lab coat. The ritual was pleasing, as though the old store&#x2014;with its shelves of toothpaste, vitamins, cosmetics, hair adornments, even sewing needles and greeting cards, as well as red rubber hot water bottles, enema pumps&#x2014;was a person altogether steady and steadfast. And any unpleasantness that may have occurred back in his home, any uneasiness at the way his wife often left their bed to wander through their home in the night&#x2019;s dark hours&#x2014;all this receded like a shoreline as he walked through the safety of his pharmacy. Standing in the back, with the drawers and rows of pills, Henry was cheerful when the phone began to ring, cheerful when Mrs. Merriman came for her blood pressure medicine, or old Cliff Mott arrived for his digitalis, cheerful when he prepared the Valium for Rachel Jones, whose husband ran off the night their baby was born. It was Henry&#x2019;s nature to listen, and many times during the week he would say, &#x201c;Gosh, I&#x2019;m awful sorry to hear that,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Say, isn&#x2019;t that something?&#x201d; Inwardly, he suffered the quiet trepidations of a man who had witnessed twice in childhood the nervous breakdowns of a mother who had otherwise cared for him with stridency. And so if, as rarely happened, a customer was distressed over a price, or irritated by the quality of an Ace bandage or ice pack, Henry did what he could to rectify things quickly. For many years Mrs. Granger worked for him; her husband was a lobster fisherman, and she seemed to carry with her the cold breeze of the open water, not so eager to please a wary customer. He had to listen with half an ear as he filled prescriptions, to make sure she was not at the cash register dismissing a complaint. More than once he was reminded of that same sensation in watching to see that his wife, Olive, did not bear down too hard on Christopher over a homework assignment or a chore left undone; that sense of his attention hovering&#x2014;the need to keep everyone content. When he heard a briskness in Mrs. Granger&#x2019;s voice, he would step down from his back post, moving toward the center of the store to talk with the customer himself. Otherwise, Mrs. Granger did her job well. He appreciated that she was not chatty, kept perfect inventory, and almost never called in sick. That she died in her sleep one night astonished him, and left him with some feeling of responsibility, as though he had missed, working alongside her for years, whatever symptom might have shown itself that he, handling his pills and syrups and syringes, could have fixed. &#x201c;Mousy,&#x201d; his wife said, when he hired the new girl. &#x201c;Looks just like a mouse.&#x201d; Denise Thibodeau had round cheeks, and small eyes that peeped through her brown-framed glasses. &#x201c;But a nice mouse,&#x201d; Henry said. &#x201c;A cute one.&#x201d; &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s cute who can&#x2019;t stand up straight,&#x201d; Olive said. It was true that Denise&#x2019;s narrow shoulders sloped forward, as though apologizing for something. She was twenty-two, just out of the state university of Vermont. Her husband was also named Henry, and Henry Kitteridge, meeting Henry Thibodeau for the first time, was taken with what he saw as an unself-conscious excellence. The young man was vigorous and sturdy-featured with a light in his eye that seemed to lend a flickering resplendence to his decent, ordinary face. He was a plumber, working in a business owned by his uncle. He and Denise had been married one year. &#x201c;Not keen on it,&#x201d; Olive said, when he suggested they have the young couple to dinner. Henry let it drop. This was a time when his son&#x2014;not yet showing the physical signs of adolescence&#x2014;had become suddenly and strenuously sullen, his mood like a poison shot through the air, and Olive seemed as changed and changeable as Christopher, the two having fast and furious fights that became just as suddenly some blanket of silent intimacy where Henry, clueless, stupefied, would find himself to be the odd man out. But standing in the back parking lot at the end of a late summer day, while he spoke with Denise and Henry Thibodeau, and the sun tucked itself behind the spruce trees, Henry Kitteridge felt such a longing to be in the presence of this young couple, their faces turned to him with a diffident but eager interest as he recalled his own days at the university many years ago, that he said, &#x201c;Now, say. Olive and I would like you to come for supper soon.&#x201d; He drove home, past the tall pines, past the glimpse of the bay, and thought of the Thibodeaus driving the other way, to their trailer on the outskirts of town. He pictured the trailer, cozy and picked up&#x2014;for Denise was neat in her habits&#x2014;and imagined them sharing the news of their day. Denise might say, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s an easy boss.&#x201d; And Henry might say, &#x201c;Oh, I like the guy a lot.&#x201d; He pulled into his driveway, which was not a driveway so much as a patch of lawn on top of the hill, and saw Olive in the garden. &#x201c;Hello, Olive,&#x201d; he said, walking to her. He wanted to put his arms around her, but she had a darkness that seemed to stand beside her like an acquaintance that would not go away. He told her the Thibodeaus were coming for supper. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only right,&#x201d; he said. Olive wiped sweat from her upper lip, turned to rip up a clump of onion grass. &#x201c;Then that&#x2019;s that, Mr. President,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Give your order to the cook.&#x201d; On Friday night the couple followed him home, and the young Henry shook Olive&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Nice place here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;With that view of the water. Mr. Kitteridge says you two built this yourselves.&#x201d; &#x201c;Indeed, we did.&#x201d; Christopher sat sideways at the table, slumped in adolescent gracelessness, and did not respond when Henry Thibodeau asked him if he played any sports at school. Henry Kitteridge felt an unexpected fury sprout inside him; he wanted to shout at the boy, whose poor manners, he felt, revealed something unpleasant not expected to be found in the Kitteridge home. &#x201c;When you work in a pharmacy,&#x201d; Olive told Denise, setting before her a plate of baked beans, &#x201c;you learn the secrets of everyone in town.&#x201d; Olive sat down across from her, pushed forward a bottle of ketchup. &#x201c;Have to know to keep your mouth shut. But seems like you know how to do that.&#x201d; &#x201c;Denise understands,&#x201d; Henry Kitteridge said. Denise&#x2019;s husband said, &#x201c;Oh, sure. You couldn&#x2019;t find someone more trustworthy than Denise.&#x201d; &#x201c;I believe you,&#x201d; Henry said, passing the man a basket of rolls. &#x201c;And please. Call me Henry. One of my favorite names,&#x201d; he added. Denise laughed quietly; she liked him, he could see this. Christopher slumped farther into his seat. Henry Thibodeau&#x2019;s parents lived on a farm inland, and so the two Henrys discussed crops, and pole beans, and the corn not being as sweet this summer from the lack of rain, and how to get a good asparagus bed. &#x201c;Oh, for God&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; said Olive, when, in passing the ketchup to the young man, Henry Kitteridge knocked it over, and ketchup lurched out like thickened blood across the oak table. Trying to pick up the bottle, he caused it to roll unsteadily, and ketchup ended up on his fingertips, then on his white shirt. &#x201c;Leave it,&#x201d; Olive commanded, standing up. &#x201c;Just leave it alone, Henry. For God&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d; And Henry Thibodeau, perhaps at the sound of his own name being spoken sharply, sat back, looking stricken. &#x201c;Gosh, what a mess I&#x2019;ve made,&#x201d; Henry Kitteridge said. For dessert they were each handed a blue bowl with a scoop of vanilla ice cream sliding in its center. &#x201c;Vanilla&#x2019;s my favorite,&#x201d; Denise said. &#x201c;Is it,&#x201d; said Olive. &#x201c;Mine, too,&#x201d; Henry Kitteridge said. As autumn came, the mornings darker, and the pharmacy getting only a short sliver of the direct sun before it passed over the building and left the store lit by its own overhead lights, Henry stood in the back filling the small plastic bottles, answering the telephone, while Denise stayed up front near the cash register. At lunchtime, she unwrapped a sandwich she brought from home, and ate it in the back where the storage was, and then he would eat his lunch, and sometimes when there was no one in the store, they would linger with a cup of coffee bought from the grocer next door. Denise seemed a naturally quiet girl, but she was given to spurts of sudden talkativeness. &#x201c;My mother&#x2019;s had MS for years, you know, so starting way back we all learned to help out. All three of my brothers are different. Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s funny when it happens that way?&#x201d; The oldest brother, Denise said, straightening a bottle of shampoo, had been her father&#x2019;s favorite until he&#x2019;d married a girl her father didn&#x2019;t like. Her own in-laws were wonderful, she said. She&#x2019;d had a boyfriend before Henry, a Protestant, and his parents had not been so kind to her. &#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t have worked out,&#x201d; she said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. &#x201c;Well, Henry&#x2019;s a terrific young man,&#x201d; Henry answered. She nodded, smiling through her glasses like a thirteen-year-old girl. Again, he pictured her trailer, the two of them like overgrown puppies tumbling together; he could not have said why this gave him the particular kind of happiness it did, like liquid gold being poured through him. She was as efficient as Mrs. Granger had been, but more relaxed. &#x201c;Right beneath the vitamins in the second aisle,&#x201d; she would tell a customer. &#x201c;Here, I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d; Once, she told Henry she sometimes let a person wander around the store before asking if she could help them. &#x201c;That way, see, they might find something they didn&#x2019;t know they needed. And your sales will go up.&#x201d; A block of winter sun was splayed across the glass of the cosmetics shelf; a strip of wooden floor shone like honey. He raised his eyebrows appreciatively. &#x201c;Lucky for me, Denise, when you came through that door.&#x201d; She pushed up her glasses with the back of her hand, then ran the duster over the ointment jars. Jerry McCarthy, the boy who delivered the pharmaceuticals once a week from Portland&#x2014;or more often if needed&#x2014;would sometimes have his lunch in the back room. He was eighteen, right out of high school; a big, fat kid with a smooth face, who perspired so much that splotches of his shirt would be wet, at times even down over his breasts, so the poor fellow looked to be lactating. Seated on a crate, his big knees practically to his ears, he&#x2019;d eat a sandwich that had spilling from it mayonnaisey clumps of egg salad or tuna fish, landing on his shirt. More than once Henry saw Denise hand him a paper towel. &#x201c;That happens to me,&#x201d; Henry heard her say one day. &#x201c;Whenever I eat a sandwich that isn&#x2019;t just cold cuts, I end up a mess.&#x201d; It couldn&#x2019;t have been true. The girl was neat as a pin, if plain as a plate. &#x201c;Good afternoon,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say when the telephone rang. &#x201c;This is the Village Pharmacy. How can I help you today?&#x201d; Like a girl playing grown-up. And then: On a Monday morning when the air in the pharmacy held a sharp chill, he went about opening up the store, saying, &#x201c;How was your weekend, Denise?&#x201d; Olive had refused to go to church the day before, and Henry, uncharacteristically, had spoken to her sharply. &#x201c;Is it too much to ask,&#x201d; he had found himself saying, as he stood in the kitchen in his undershorts, ironing his trousers. &#x201c;A man&#x2019;s wife accompanying him to church?&#x201d; Going without her seemed a public exposure of familial failure. &#x201c;Yes, it most certainly is too goddamn much to ask!&#x201d; Olive had almost spit, her fury&#x2019;s door flung open. &#x201c;You have no idea how tired I am, teaching all day, going to foolish meetings where the goddamn principal is a moron! Shopping. Cooking. Ironing. Laundry. Doing Christopher&#x2019;s homework with him! And you&#x2014;&#x201d; She had grabbed on to the back of a dining room chair, and her dark hair, still uncombed from its night&#x2019;s disarrangement, had fallen across her eyes. &#x201c;You, Mr. Head Deacon Claptrap Nice Guy, expect me to give up my Sunday mornings and go sit among a bunch of snot-wots!&#x201d; Very suddenly she had sat down in the chair. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m sick and tired of it,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, calmly. &#x201c;Sick to death.&#x201d; A darkness had rumbled through him; his soul was suffocating in tar. The next morning, Olive spoke to him conversationally. &#x201c;Jim&#x2019;s&nbsp; car smelled like upchuck last week. Hope he&#x2019;s cleaned it out.&#x201d; Jim&nbsp; O&#x2019;Casey taught with Olive, and for years took both Christopher and Olive to school. &#x201c;Hope so,&#x201d; said Henry, and in that way their fight was done. &#x201c;Oh, I had a wonderful weekend,&#x201d; said Denise, her small eyes behind her glasses looking at him with an eagerness that was so childlike it could have cracked his heart in two. &#x201c;We went to Henry&#x2019;s folks and dug potatoes at night. Henry put the headlights on from the car and we dug potatoes. Finding the potatoes in that cold soil&#x2014;like an Easter egg hunt!&#x201d; He stopped unpacking a shipment of penicillin, and stepped down to talk to her. There were no customers yet, and below the front window the radiator hissed. He said, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that lovely, Denise.&#x201d; She nodded, touching the top of the vitamin shelf beside her. A small motion of fear seemed to pass over her face. &#x201c;I got cold and went and sat in the car and watched Henry digging potatoes, and I thought: It&#x2019;s too good to be true.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Improv Handbook: The Ultimate Guide to Improvising in Comedy, Theatre, and Beyond</h2><p><p>The most comprehensive, smart, helpful and inspiring guide to improve available today.

A chronicle of the author's search for a civilization "reduced to its most basic expression."</p><p>"I hate travelling and explorers," famously declared Claude L�vi-Strauss, but how fortunate for readers that he should overcome his loathing to write about his experiences among the indigenous peoples of the Brazilian interior, including the Caduveo, Bororo, and Nambikwara tribes. Those who know L�vi-Strauss and <i>Tristes Tropiques</i> by reputation only will be pleasantly surprised by the intimate tone that colors even its most precise anthropological sections, as well as the autobiographical passages at the beginning, in which the author recounts how he fell into his career and how, shortly after the Nazis occupied Paris, he was forced to flee to America in a grueling sea voyage. Twenty-five black-and-white photographs of tribespeople, as well as numerous line drawings, accompany the text.Tristes Tropiques is one of the great books of our century," said Susan Sontag. "It is rigorous, subtle, and bold in thought. It is beauti-<br>fully written. And, like all great books, it bears an absolutely personal stamp; it speaks with a human voice."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tristes Tropiques was an immensely popular bestseller when it was first published in <br>France in 1955. Claude L�vi-Strauss's ground-<br>breaking study of the societies of a number of Amazonian peoples is a cornerstone of structural anthropology and an exploration by the author of his own intellectual roots as a professor of philosophy in Brazil before the Second World War, as a Jewish exile from Nazi-occupied Europe, and later as a world-renowned academic (he taught at New York's New School for Social Research and was French cultural attach� to the United States). L�vi-Strauss's central journey leads from the Amazon basin through the dense upland jungles of Brazil. There, among the Amerindian tribes--the Caduveo, Bororo, Nambikwara, and Tupi-Kawahib--he found "a human society reduced to its most basic expression." L�vi-Strauss's discussion of his fieldwork in Tristes Tropiques endures as a milestone of anthropology, but the book is also, in its brilliant diversions on other, more familiar cultures, a great work of literature, a vivid travelogue, and an engaging memoir--a demonstration of the marvelous mental agility of one of the century<br>'s most important thinkers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presented here is the translation by John and Doreen Weightman of the complete text of the revised French edition of 1968, together with the original photographs and illustrations. <br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inaugurat-<br>ing a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</p><h2>The Last Policeman</h2><p><p><b>"[The] weird, beautiful, unapologetically apocalyptic Last Policeman trilogy is one of my favorite mystery series."&#x2014;John Green, author of The Fault in Our Stars and Paper Towns<br><br>Winner of the 2013 Edgar�&nbsp;Award Winner for Best Paperback Original!<br></b><br>What&#x2019;s the point in solving murders if we&#x2019;re all going to die soon, anyway?<br> &nbsp;<br> Detective Hank Palace has faced this question ever since asteroid 2011GV1 hovered into view.

But in the hands of Ben Winters (<i>Sense and Sensibility and Seamonsters</i>), the mash-up of murder mystery and gloomy end-of-world melodrama works perfectly. Detective Hank Palace knows the world will likely be destroyed in six months by the meteor headed toward earth like a bullet. But unlike those who are giving up, quitting jobs, doing drugs, running away, or killing themselves, Palace has a job to do. He&#x2019;s got a murder to solve. So he keeps plugging away, unwilling to let the looming apocalypse distract him from finding the killer. Palace is an appealingly off-kilter character, more goofball than hard-boiled. So it&#x2019;s a very good thing that this is the first in a planned trilogy. --<i>Neal Thompson</i></p> <p><b> Amazon Exclusive: Q&amp;A with Ben H. Winters</b></p> <p> <strong><em>The Last Policeman</em></strong><strong> is set in a world in which a massive asteroid is hurtling toward Earth, but the novel centers on one detective's murder investigation. Where did you get the idea to combine these two disparate elements of storytelling?</strong></p> <p> Well, you know, story ideas are like giant planet-dooming asteroids: they always take you by surprise. But I've always had a soft spot for certain kinds of science fiction, books that imagine one grand change to the human situation and tease it out. P. D. James's <em>Children of Men</em> is a marvelous example, or Philip Jos� Farmer's Riverworld series.&nbsp;</p> <p> The "pre-apocalyptic" side of this "pre-apocalyptic murder mystery" definitely came first. I thought it would be fascinating to imagine my way into the sad and terrifying last months of civilization. Then I set about imagining the right hero for this kind of book, and I thought that what I needed was someone who is extremely dedicated to his work, who cannot let the world end before solving the puzzle before him.&nbsp;That's where the character of Detective Henry Palace came from, my intensely, even bizarrely dedicated public servant.</p> <p> <strong>The obligatory question: What would you do if Earth would be annihilated in six months?</strong></p> <p> Well, I'm under contract with Quirk Books to write the sequel to <em>The Last Policeman</em>, so first I'd get that done.&nbsp;</p> <p> Just kidding. I think, honestly, that I would spend time with my children. I'd read them a lot of books, and take them to beautiful places, and try to prevent them from hearing anything about what was coming. (The idea of that, by the way, makes me tearful, as it did periodically over the course of writing this.)&nbsp;</p> <p> <strong>Can you give us any details about the upcoming second and third novels in the series?</strong></p> <p> Like <em>The Last Policeman</em>, each of the sequels will have at its center a crime that Palace is trying to solve. But, also like this one, each will be at least equally interested in the details of the disintegrating world, and in plumbing the psyche of this lawman: how and why he remains "on the job" even as the job, along with the rest of civilization, crumbles around him.</p><i>New York Times </i>best-selling author <b>Ben H.

A stranger has taken the place of the Hogfather. Well, not exactly a stranger. He's actually pretty well known. He carries a scythe along with his bag of toys, and he's going to SLEIGH everyone he sees tonight.</p><p>Ho ho ho.</p><p>Even the laugh is wrong. The switch has been arranged by the Auditors, mysterious superbeings who want our universe to be a collection of rocks swinging in curves through space. Life is messy. Why not get rid of it? And who better than -- you know who?</p><p>Somebody has to rescue the real Hogfather before this morbid impostor tracks soot on the world's carpets. It's up to Ankh-Morpork's intellectual elite, the assembled wizards of Unseen University -- with the help of a monster-bashing nanny, the world's worst inventor, plus a bona-fide, honest-to-god god (the oh god of hangovers, to be precise) -- to come up with a plan to save the universe. </p><p>And they'd better hurry. The bogus Hogfather is asking the wrong questions. Like: <em>How come rich kids get all the nice toys? How come the poor kids are left with the cheap stuff?</em></p><p>"That's life," he is told. </p><p>Which cuts no ice with Death. </p></p><p>What could more genuinely embody the spirit of Christmas (or Hogswatch, on the Discworld) than a Terry Pratchett book about the holiday season? Every secular Christmas tradition is included. But as this <i>is</i> the 21st Discworld novel, there are some unusual twists. <p> This year the Auditors, who want people to stop believing in things that aren't real, have hired an assassin to eliminate the Hogfather. (You know him: red robe, white beard, says, "Ho, ho, ho!") Their evil plot will destroy the Discworld unless someone covers for him. So someone does. Well, at least Death <i>tries</i>. He wears the costume and rides the sleigh drawn by four jolly pigs: Gouger, Tusker, Rooter, and Snouter. He even comes down chimneys. But as fans of other Pratchett stories about Death (<i>Mort</i>, <i>Reaper Man</i>, and <i>Soul Music</i>) know, he takes things literally. He gives children whatever they wish for and appears in person at Crumley's in The Maul. </p><p> Fans will welcome back Susan, Death of Rats (the Grim Squeaker), Albert, and the wizardly faculty of Unseen University, and revel in new personalities like Bilious, the "oh god of Hangovers." But you needn't have read Pratchett before to laugh uproariously and think seriously about the meanings of Christmas. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>"Has the energy of "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the inventiveness of <i>Alice in Wonderland...</i>It has also an intelligent wit and a truly original grim and comic grasp of the nature of things." <br>-A.S.

Near the ball, Angelique Crozat, an octoroon who travels in the city&#39;s finest company, is found murdered--and there is no shortage of suspects. This novel transports the reader to the center of the cosmopolitan South in an age when both its glories and the forces which would tear it apart are equally in evidence.</p><p>In Barbara Hambly&#39;s rich and poignant thriller, it&#39;s 1833 and Ben January--a man of mixed blood making his living as a musician because he&#39;s not allowed to practice surgery--is back home in New Orleans after years of freedom in Paris. Trying to walk a caste line more complicated than India&#39;s, January risks his precarious position to investigate the killing of a young woman who--like his own younger, lighter half-sister--is the mistress of a wealthy white man. What has changed most in New Orleans while Ben was away is the influence of the white Americans: rough, ignorant, instinctively racist. Only one of these--a policeman named Abishag Shaw--seems to understand that January is at least as smart and valuable as he is, and even he at times appears to be ready to side with the white majority and pin the crime on Ben.Barbara Hambly is the author of <b>The Emancipator&#x2019;s Wife</b>, a finalist for the Michael Shaara Award for Excellence in Civil War Fiction.

Quite a journey!</p><p>Award-winning illustrator Stephen Biesty specializes in historical and architectural cutaway drawings.Grade 3-7&#x2013;Employing his large, trademark cross-section or cut-away style illustrations that are full of detail and bustling small figures, Biesty, supported by Ross, uses the fictional construct of family members traveling to a wedding as a way of exploring various aspects of daily life in Egypt around the year 1230 B.C.E. The main narrative consists of not more than 1000 words, providing the broad outline of the journey and information about the sights along the way. The longer supplementary text includes labels identifying characters and objects in the illustrations; short paragraphs explaining what readers are looking at; and additional paragraphs providing more general information. Of course, the book's raison d'�tre is the artwork. Laid out in panoramic spreads, it demonstrates such important subjects as how the Egyptians farmed their land after the annual Nile flood, how their houses were constructed and utilized, and what went on at a busy harbor. Most of the information is available in other books, although such topics as hippo hunts and restrooms are less common. But the amount of detail included in Biesty's illustrations and the attention required to ferret all of it out make the book as visually stimulating as Martin Handford's Where's Waldo titles and almost as useful as the longer, more architectural books by David Macaulay. Librarians might be reduced to using magnifying glasses, but students with sharp eyes and an interest in ancient Egypt will have no trouble extracting what they want to know.<i>&#x2013;Coop Renner, Hillside Elementary, El Paso, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

You will have a hard time putting this book down before you reach the stunning conclusion." &#x2015; Pamela Klinger-Horn, Excelsior Bay Books </p><p>"John Hart loves the terrain where good people tough by nature or circumstance try to set things right while also rarely asking for help. Mix that with some very bad folks twisted by power and desire and you have the kind of riveting atmospheric story he's great at. Vivid characters determined to get to the bottom of things, breaking through their own reserve to join forces and protect the weak. Redemption Road is deeply engaging from beginning to end.

I love the richness of his stories and the paths this characters chose to in fact achieve some kind of redemption for the powerless." &#x2015; Sheryl Cotleur, Cooperfield's Books</p><p>"Redemption Road is the best thriller I have read in the past 10 years. You have a damaged cop that refuses to help herself, an ex-cop leaving prison after serving time for a murder he didn't commit and a serial killer who is unknown in the town he has been preying upon for years.

Yet at other times, the violence and cruelty he describes are almost too horrible to read.

See Beatrix Potter&#39;s familiar characters in action in this high-quality pop-up book, based on the original illustrations and including the full, authorized text. 6 full-color spreads.</p><p>The quintessential cautionary tale, <i>Peter Rabbit</i> warns naughty children about the grave consequences of misbehaving. When Mrs. Rabbit beseeches her four furry children not to go into Mr. McGregor's garden, the impish Peter naturally takes this as an open invitation to create mischief. He quickly gets in over his head, when he is spotted by farmer McGregor himself. Any child with a spark of sass will find Peter's adventures remarkably familiar. And they'll see in Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail that bane of their existence: the "good" sibling who always does the right thing. One earns bread and milk and blackberries for supper, while the obstinate folly of the other warrants medicine and an early bedtime. <p> Beatrix Potter's animal stories have been a joy to generations of young readers. Her warm, playful illustrations in soft colors invite children into the world of words and flights of fancy. Once there, she gently and humorously guides readers along the path of righteousness, leaving just enough room for children to wonder if that incorrigible Peter will be back in McGregor's garden tomorrow. <i>(Ages Baby to Preschool)</i></p>Mr. McGregor has two things on his mind when he sees Peter in his garden. One is the safety of his lettuces; the other is rabbit pie. Peter was carefully told not to go into Mr. McGregor's garden, but some little bunnies have to learn things the hard way. Beatrix Potter's classic story has been lovingly placed at the center of this creative effort, and David Jorgensen has given Peter and his family wonderfully droll and expressive character and charm in his illustrations. On the accompanying audiocaasette, Meryl Streep explores all of the drame, humor, and subtlety of the narrative, and none of its potential to entertain and teach has been left untapped. Musician/composer Lyle Mays has coordinated and augmented the work of both illustrator and narrator with a score that unifies and enlivens the whole enterprise. The combined artistry of the contributors results in a new and enriching experience that will be loved by all. <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i> was awarded a Grammy nomination for best recording for children in 1988.</p><h2>The Unheavenly City Revisited : A Revision of the Unheavenly City</h2><p>With its publication in 1970, Edward Banfield&#39;s The Unheavenly City provoked intense discussion among students, scholars, and general readers.

Jammu. No sooner has Jammu been installed, though, than the city's leading citizens become embroiled in an all-pervasive political conspiracy. A classic of contemporary fiction, <i>The Twenty-Seventh City</i> shows us an ordinary metropolis turned inside out, and the American Dream unraveling into terror and dark comedy.</p></p><p><p><b>Jonathan Franzen</b> is the author of <i>The Corrections</i>, <i>The Twenty-Seventh City</i> and <i>Strong Motion</i>. He has been named one of the Granta 20 Best Novelists under 40 and is a frequent contributor to<i> The New Yorker</i> and <i>Harper's.</i><br><i></i></p>1<br>&nbsp;<br><br>In early June Chief William O'Connell of the St. Louis Police Department announced his retirement, and the Board of Police Commissioners, passing over the favored candidates of the city political establishment, the black community, the press, the Officers Association and the Missouri governor, selected a woman, formerly with the police in Bombay, India, to begin a five-year term as chief. The city was appalled, but the woman--one S. Jammu--assumed the post before anyone could stop her.<br>This was on August 1. On August 4, the Subcontinent again made the local news when the most eligible bachelor in St. Louis married a princess from Bombay. The groom was Sidney Hammaker, president of the Hammaker Brewing Company, the city's flagship industry. The bride was rumored to be fabulously wealthy. Newspaper accounts of the wedding confirmed reports that she owned a diamond pendant insured for $11 million, and that she had brought a retinue of eighteen servants to staff the Hammaker estate in suburban Ladue. A fireworks display at the wedding reception rained cinders on lawns up to a mile away.<br>A week later the sightings began. An Indian family of ten was seen standing on a traffic island one block east of the Cervantes Convention Center. The women wore saris, the men dark business suits, the children gym shorts and T-shirts. All of them wore expressions of controlled annoyance.<br>By the beginning of September, scenes like this had become a fixture of daily life in the city. Indians were noticed lounging with no evident purpose on the skybridge between Dillard's and the St. Louis Centre. They were observed spreading blankets in the art museum parking lot and preparing a hot lunch on a Primus stove, playing card games on the sidewalk in front of the National Bowling Hall of Fame, viewing houses for sale in Kirkwood and Sunset Hills, taking snapshots outside the Amtrak station downtown, and clustering around the raised hood of a Delta 88 stalled on the Forest Park Parkway. The children invariably appeared well behaved.<br>Early autumn was also the season of another, more familiar Eastern visitor to St. Louis, the Veiled Prophet of Khorassan. A group of businessmen had conjured up the Prophet in the nineteenth century to help raise funds for worthy causes. Each year He returned and incarnated Himself in a different leading citizen whose identity was always a closely guarded secret, and with His non-denominational mysteries He brought a playful glamour to the city. It had been written:<br><i>There on that throne, to which the blind belief</i><br><i>Of millions rais'd him, sat the Prophet-Chief</i>,<br><i>The Great Mokanna. O'er his features bung</i><br><i>The Veil, the Silver Veil, which he had flung</i><br><i>In mercy there, to hide from mortal sight</i><br><i>His dazzling brow, till man could bear its light</i>.<br>It rained only once in September, on the day of the Veiled Prophet Parade. Water streamed down the tuba bells in the marching bands, and trumpeters experienced difficulties with their embouchure. Pom-poms wilted, staining the girls' hands with dye, which they smeared on their foreheads when they pushed back their hair. Several of the floats sank.<br>On the night of the Veiled Prophet Ball, the year's premier society event, high winds knocked down power lines all over the city. In the Khorassan Room of the Chase-Park Plaza Hotel, the debbing had just concluded when the lights went out. Waiters rushed in with candelabras, and when the first of them were lit the ballroom filled with murmurs of surprise and consternation: the Prophet's throne was empty.<br>On Kingshighway a black Ferrari 275 was speeding past the windowless supermarkets and fortified churches of the city's north side. Observers might have glimpsed a snow-white robe behind the windshield, a crown on the passenger seat. The Prophet was driving to the airport. Parking in a fire lane, He dashed into the lobby of the Marriott Hotel.<br>"You got some kind of problem there?" a bellhop said.<br>"I'm the Veiled Prophet, twit."<br>On the top floor of the hotel He stopped outside a door and knocked. The door was opened by a tall dark woman in a jogging suit. She was very pretty. She burst out laughing.<br><br>When the sky began to lighten, low in the east over southern Illinois, the birds were the first to know it. Along the riverfront and in all the downtown parks and plazas, the trees began to chirp and rustle. It was the first Monday morning in October. The birds downtown were waking up.<br>North of the business district, where the poorest people lived, an early morning breeze carried smells of used liquor and unnatural perspiration out of alleyways where nothing moved; a slamming door was heard for blocks around. In the railyards of the city's central basin, amid the buzzing of faulty chargers and the sudden ghostly shiverings of Cyclone fences, men with flattops dozed in square-headed towers while rolling stock regrouped below them. Three-star hotels and private hospitals with an abject visibility occupied the higher ground. Farther west, the land grew hilly and healthier trees knit the settlements together, but this was not St. Louis anymore, it was suburb. On the south side there were rows upon rows of cubical brick houses where widows and widowers lay in beds and the blinds in the windows, lowered in a different era, would not be raised all day.<br>But no part of the city was deader than downtown. Here in the heart of St. Louis, in the lee of the whining all-night traffic on four expressways, was a wealth of parking spaces. Here sparrows bickered and pigeons ate. Here City Hall, a hip-roofed copy of the H�tel de Ville in Paris, rose in two-dimensional splendor from a flat, vacant block. The air on Market Street, the central thoroughfare, was wholesome. On either side of it you could hear the birds both singly and in chorus--it was like a meadow. It was like a back yard.<br>The keeper of this peace had been awake all night on Clark Avenue, just south of City Hall. Chief Jammu, on the fifth floor of police headquarters, was opening the morning paper and spreading it out beneath her desk lamp. It was still dark in her office, and from the neck down, with her hunched, narrow shoulders and her bony knees in knee socks and her restless feet, the Chief looked for all the world like a schoolgirl who'd been cramming.<br>Her head was older. As she leaned over the newspaper, the lamplight picked out white strands in the silky black hair above her left ear. Like Indira Gandhi, who on this October morning was still alive and the prime minister of India, Jammu showed signs of asymmetric graying. She kept her hair just long enough to pin it up in back. She had a large forehead, a hooked and narrow nose, and wide lips that looked blood-starved, bluish. When she was rested, her dark eyes dominated her face, but this morning they were cloudy and crowded by pouches. Wrinkles cut the smooth skin around her mouth.<br>Turning a page of the <i>Post-Dispatch</i> she found what she wanted, a picture of her taken on a good day. She was smiling, her eyes engaging. The caption<i>--Jammu: an eye to the personal--</i>brought the same smile back. The accompanying article, by Joseph Feig, had run under the headline A NEW LEASE ON LIFE. She began to read.<br>Few people remember it now, but the name Jammu first appeared in American newspapers nearly a decade ago. The year was 1975. The Indian subcontinent was in turmoil following Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's suspension of civil rights and her crackdown on her political foes.<br>Amid conflicting, heavily censored reports, a strange story from the city of Bombay began to unfold in the Western press. The reports concerned an operation known as Project Poori, implemented by a police official named Jammu. In Bombay, it seemed, the police department had gone into the wholesale food business.<br>The operation sounded crazy then; it sounds hardly less crazy today. But now that a twist of fate has brought Jammu to St. Louis in the role of police chief, people here are asking themselves whether Project Poori was really so crazy after all.<br>In a recent interview in her spacious Clark Avenue office, Jammu spoke of the circumstances that led up to the project.<br>"Before Mrs. Gandhi dispensed with the constitution the country was like Gertrude's Denmark--rotten to the core. But with the imposition of President's Rule, we in law enforcement had our chance to do something about it. In Bombay alone we were locking up 1,500 lawbreakers a week and impounding 30 million rupees in illegal goods and cash. When we evaluated our efforts after two months, we realized we'd hardly made one speck of progress," Jammu recalled.<br>President's Rule devolves from a clause in the Indian constitution giving the central government sweeping powers in times of emergency. For this reason, the 19 months of such rule were referred to as the Emergency.<br>In 1975 a rupee was worth about ten U.S. cents.<br>"I was an assistant commissioner at the time," Jammu said. "I suggested a different approach. Since threats and arrests weren't working, why not try defeating corruption on its own terms?<br>"Why not enter a business ourselves and use our resources and influence to achieve a freer market? We chose an essential commodity: food," she said.<br>It was thus that Project Poori was conceived. A <i>poori</i> is a deep-fried puff-bread, popular in India. By the end of 1975, Bombay was known to Western journalists as the one city in India where groceries were plentiful and the prices uninflated.<br>Naturally, attention centered on Jammu. Her handling of the operation, as detailed in the dailies and in <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i>, caught the imagination of police forces in this country. But certainly no one would have guessed that one day she would be in St. Louis wearing the Chief's badge on her blouse and a department revolver on her hip.<br>Colonel Jammu, however, entering her third month in office, would have it seem the most natural thing in the world. "A good chief stresses personal involvement at all levels of the organization," she said. "Carrying a revolver is one symbol of my commitment.<br>"Of course, it's also an instrument of lethal force," she continued, leaning back in her office chair.<br>Jammu's frank, gutsy style of law-enforcement management has earned a reputation that is literally world-wide. When the search for a replacement for former Chief William O'Connell ended in its deadlock of opposing factions, Jammu's name was among the first mentioned as a compromise candidate. And despite the fact that she had no previous law-enforcement experience in the U.S., the Police Board confirmed her appointment less than a week after she arrived in St. Louis for interviews.<br>To many here, it came as a surprise that this Indian woman met the citizenship requirements necessary for her job. But Jammu, who was born in Los Angeles and whose father was American, says she went to great lengths to preserve her citizenship. Since she was a child she has dreamed of settling in America.<br>"I'm terribly patriotic," she said with a smile. "New residents, like myself, often are. I'm looking forward to spending many years in St. Louis. I'm here to stay."<br>Jammu speaks with slightly British intonations and striking clarity of thought. With her fine features and delicate build, she could hardly be less like the stereotype of the gruff, male American police chief. But her record gives an altogether different impression.<br>Within five years of entering the Indian Police Service in 1969, she became a deputy to the Inspector-General of Police in Maharashtra Province. Five years later, at the astonishing age of 31, she was named Commissioner of the Bombay police. At 35, she is both the youngest police chief in modern St. Louis history and the first woman to hold the post.<br>Before joining the Indian police she received a B.A. in electrical science from the University of Srinagar in Kashmir. She also did three semesters of postgraduate work in economics at the University of Chicago.<br>"I've worked hard," she said. "I've had plenty of luck, too. I doubt I'd have this job had I not received good press from Project Poori. But of course the real problem was always my sex. It wasn't easy to buck five millennia of sexual discrimination.<br>"Until I became a superintendent I routinely dressed as a man," Jammu reminisced.<br>Apparently, experiences like this played a key role in the Commissioners' selection of Jammu. In a city still struggling to overcome its image as a "loser," the Board's unorthodox choice makes good public-relations sense. St. Louis is now the largest U.S. city to have a female police chief.<br>Nelson A. Nelson, president of the Board, believes St. Louis should take credit for its leading role in making city government accessible to women. "It's affirmative action in the truest sense of the word," he commented.<br>Jammu, however, appeared to discount the issue. "Yes, I'm a woman, all right," she said with a smile.<br>As one of her primary goals, she names making city streets safer. While not offering to comment on the performances of past chiefs in this area, she did say that she was working closely with City Hall to devise a comprehensive plan for fighting street crime.<br>"The city needs a new lease on life, a fundamental shake-up. If we can get the business community and citizens' groups to aid us--if we can make people see that this is a <i>regional</i> problem--I'm convinced that in a very short time we can make the streets safe again," she said.<br>Chief Jammu is not afraid of making her ambitions known. One might venture to guess that she will meet with jealous opposition in whatever she attempts. But her accomplishments in India show her to be a formidable adversary, and a political figure well worth keeping an eye on.<br>"Project Poori is a good illustration," she pointed out. "We applied a new set of terms to a situation that appeared hopeless. We set up bazaars outside every station house. It improved our public image, and it improved morale. For the first time in decades we had no trouble attracting well-qualified recruits. Indian police have a reputation for corruption and brutality which is largely due to the inability to recruit responsible, well-educated constables. Project Poori began to change things."<br>Some of Jammu's critics have voiced fears that a police chief accustomed to the more authoritarian atmosphere of India might be insensitive to civil-rights issues in St. Louis. Charles Grady, spokesman for the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, has gone even further, urging that Jammu be dismissed before a "constitutional disaster" occurs.<br>Jammu strenuously rejects these criticisms. "I've been quite surprised by the reactions of the liberal community here," she said.<br>"Their concern arises, I believe, from an abiding distrust of the Third World in general. They overlook the fact that India's system of government has been deeply influenced by Western ideals, particularly, of course, by the British. They fail to distinguish between the Indian police rank-and-file, and the national officer corps, of which I was a member.<br>"We were trained in the British tradition of civil service. Standards were extremely high. We were continually torn between sticking up for our troops and sticking up for our ideals. My critics overlook the fact that it was this very conflict which made a position in the United States attractive to me.<br>"In fact, what strikes me now about Project Poori is how American our approach was. Into a clogged and bankrupt economy we injected a harsh dose of free enterprise. Soon hoarders found their goods worth half of what they'd paid for them. Profiteers went begging for customers. On a small scale, we achieved a genuine <i>Wirtschaftswunder</i>," Jammu recalled, refe...</p><h2>Glencoe Math Accelerated, A Pre-Algebra Program Volume 1 Teacher Walkaround Edition, Common Core Edition</h2><p>Glencoe Math Accelerated, A Pre-Algebra Program Volume 1 Teacher Walkaround Edition, Common Core Edition</p><p></p><h2>Handwriting Without Tears: Get Set for School Teacher&#39;s Guide (Pre-K)</h2><p>When trying to learn to write brought her little boy to tears, Jan Olsen found a remedy.

Strategically countering the traditional erasure of women&#x2019;s achievements, this epic installation honours 1038 iconic, mythical, archetypal and historical women. This, the most definitive book to be published on Chicago&#x2019;s masterwork, reveals more fully than ever before the art and the artist&#x2019;s expanded research into the rich history embodied in the installation. In lively contextualizing sections, Chicago discusses the creative genesis of The Dinner Party, the technical processes involved, and the work&#x2019;s early often hostile reception by the art world, and its subsequent preservation and permanent exhibition.</p><p>Judy Chicago is a world-renowned artist, author and educator. Her major installations The Dinner Party, the Birth Project, the Holocaust Project and Resolutions have been exhibited worldwide: The Dinner Party alone has attracted more than one million viewers.The world's most famous and controversial work of feminist art, Judy Chicago's <i>Dinner Party</i> has found a permanent home some 30 years after its creation in the Brooklyn Museum's new Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. Chicago celebrates in a sumptuous and comprehensive volume dedicated to her radical and extraordinarily crafted sculptural installation, telling the compelling story of its five-year collaborative creation, phenomenal popularity with the public, and vicious critical condemnation. Long committed to making socially conscious art, Chicago marvels over how much has changed in the field of women's history since the 1960s, when she began researching women's lives. Never one to stint on hard work, or miss the opportunity to educate people, Chicago presents brief and vivid updated biographies of the 39 women represented at the triangular table with elaborate ceramic plates and beautifully embroidered runners and the 999 women whose names appear in the porcelain-tiled <i>Heritage Floor</i>.

Wells, and others, giving voice to these women in a collection of diary excerpts, songs, poetry, and artwork.</p><p><p><b>Chapter 1: Royalty</b> </p><p><br> In ancient times only the deities lived in the world. <br> Their mother was Nananbouclou. <br> She hurled fired into the sky. <br> It remains to this day. <br> It is called Baiacou: <br> the Evening Star. </p><p> -- from an African folktale </p><p><br> From the dawn of civilization, Africa's royal women have shown themselves to be intelligent, resourceful, courageous, passionate -- and sometimes vulnerable. Although born and raised in different parts of the continent, they all shared a common desire to forge their own destinies and to live on in eternity. Their astounding stories, true and fabled, survive today to reveal their accomplishments and their legacies. </p><p> By 1500 B.C., Egypt's great pyramids had stood for more than ten centuries. Egypt had survived periods of plague, pestilence, and even opulence and now was enjoying a renaissance. The Hyksos -- invaders from southwest Asia who had ravaged and controlled Egypt for decades -- had been driven from Lower Egypt, the land encompassing the Nile River Delta and its northern valley. In addition, Egypt's armies were marching south to conquer Nubia, a fertile land that stretched along the banks of the Nile, near present-day Libya. While Egypt added new territories to its boundaries, it also grew internally -- to become the undisputed center of culture and politics in the larger eastern Mediterranean world. It was the beginning of the New Kingdom -- a period of great Egyptian power and wealth that would last four centuries, from around 1539 to 1070 B.C. Hatshepsut, one of Egypt's most fabled rulers, lived in the early years of this glory. </p><p> Daughter to Pharaoh Thutmose I and Queen Ahmose-Nefertere, Hatshepsut was born around 1500 B.C. Beautiful and intelligent, Hatshepsut knew a life of great wealth and privilege. When Thutmose I died around 1492 B.C., the Egyptian court insured the continuation of the royal bloodline by wedding her, a full-blooded royal, to her half-brother. Thutmose II was the new pharaoh and the son of Thutmose I by a lesser wife. (Incestuous marriages were common among Egyptian royals since the women carried the royal blood.) Though still a very young woman, Hatshepsut ruled as Thutmose II's principal queen. </p><p> She of Noble Bearing ý Great Royal Spouse ý Daughter of the God Amun ý First Lady of the Two Lands. Hatshepsut proudly wore these titles as queen. She stayed in the background when Thutmose sat on his throne, but her intelligence was always evident. Thutmose frequently left Hatshepsut in charge when he journeyed abroad -- leading successful military campaigns into Syria and Nubia that acquired both land and great wealth. Before Thutmose II died, he named his only son -- seven-year-old Thutmose III, born to a harem girl -- his successor. Since Thutmose III was too young to rule on his own, the Egyptian high court designated Hatshepsut as co-regent. A wise and ambitious woman, Hatshepsut understood her position and ruled judiciously. </p><p> Although Hatshepsut could have declared war on her neighbors, she chose to focus instead on national affairs. She built education and arts facilities. She dismantled the main army and sponsored peaceful diplomatic expeditions into Punt, Asia, Greece, and strategic areas on the continent of Africa. Later, caravans and ships followed, trading in gems, ivory, ebony, oils, spices, incense, and even trees. Hatshepsut continued to rule even after Thutmose III came of age. It appears that they split the duties: She oversaw the administration while he commanded the military. A few years later, however, with Thutmose III involved in military campaigns, Hatshepsut crowned herself pharaoh. </p><p> She used to her advantage the Egyptian belief that a royal birth resulted from the union between the pharaoh's mother and Amun-Re, the supreme deity. (Some experts believe that this notion, a heavenly god fathering a human child, may have sowed the seeds for Christianity.) Hatshepsut claimed that Amun-Re had come to Queen Ahmose-Nefertere in the human form of her husband, Thutmose I. Since she, Hatshepsut, was the child of that union, she concluded that she was the rightful child to rule all of Egypt. To legitimize her claim to the title of pharaoh, she ensured that the people of Egypt recognized her as pharaoh by always appearing in public in full royal male regalia: a simple robe, red-and-white crown, royal wig, and a nems (a striped cloth placed around the wig). She also donned a false beard, facial hair being strictly forbidden to all but the pharaoh. She even claimed a pharaoh's privilege and had a burial tomb carved out for herself in the Valley of the Kings, adjacent to that of Thutmose I. </p><p> As peace thrived under Hatshepsut's reign, wealth grew. Hatshepsut spent her fortunes on monuments to the gods, both to honor them and to ensure her prominence in the afterlife. Senmut, a renowned architect and astronomer of the era -- reportedly a Black man and her lover -- built several temples and obelisks upon her instruction. Today, Egypt claims many of Hatshepsut's commissions among its greatest wonders of the past. One such marvel is the large mortuary temple built of limestone at Deir el-Bahari intended to honor herself and her human father, Thutmose I. The temple steps back into the cliff in three levels, each faced by a colonnade and adorned with relief sculpture that depicts in great detail the glory of the expedition to Punt that Hatshepsut financed. </p><p> Another monument, the Red Temple at Karnak, housed the statue of Amun-Re. Each year during the Opet -- a celebration honoring the new year -- temple priests carried Amun-Re's statue from the Red Temple to his shrine at Luxor to receive the worship of his subjects. In return for their loyalty and offerings, Amun-Re was to shed favor upon them for the next year. Four obelisks built of red granite from Aswan and inscribed with hieroglyphics in honor of Amun-Re flanked the Red Temple. They stretched to the heavens in height and splendor, their surfaces of electrum glinting in the sun. One still stands today after 35 centuries, a hint of electrum still adorning its surface; its inscription begins: </p><p><br> <i>I have done this with a loving heart for my father Amun;<br> Initiated in his secret of the beginning,<br> Acquainted with his beneficent might, <br> I did not forget what he had ordained.<br> My majesty knows his divinity, <br> I acted under his command; <br> It was he who led me, <br> I did not plan a work without his doing.</i> </p><p><br> Hatshepsut died in 1458 B.C. after effectively ruling for more than two decades. It is not known how Hatshepsut died. What is known is that despite her opulent public life, Hatshepsut may have had one secret love. Discovered in her tomb, lying beside the great ruler, was an ebony-skinned baby, mummified and wrapped in the royal tradition with Hatshepsut's insignia. </p><p> Following Hatshepsut's death, Thutmose III assumed the full role of pharaoh. Thutmose III is said to have despised his stepmother and her reported relationship with Senmut. He felt ignored and scorned by Senmut, and he believed that Hatshepsut squandered his heritage at Senmut's directive. Perhaps in retaliation, Thutmose III ordered destroyed many of Hatshepsut's creations, especially where she was depicted with Senmut. Many temples Hatshepsut had built, as well as statues of her likeness, were defaced. On some statues the royal emblem was knocked off her headdress; on others the eyes were pecked out with a small chisel. Still, Thutmose III could not completely destroy her legacy. Her monuments -- and her story -- endure. Written on one of the obelisks at Karnak is her enduring declaration: "As I shall be eternal like an undying star." </p><p> Several decades later, with Egypt still thriving under the influence inspired by Hatshepsut, Pharaoh Amenhotep III wed Tiye, a young Nubian of noble birth. Tiye was born around 1400 B.C.; her father Yuya served Amenhotep as a Master of Horse and Chancellor of the North. According to some historians, the introduction of Tiye into Egypt's royal family changed the fate of Egypt forever -- it solidified Egypt and Nubia in a bond that brought Black Africa and North Africa together. Under Amenhotep, the kingdom stretched from the farthest tip of Egypt's New East to the Kingdom of Napata in present-day Sudan. </p><p> Amenhotep III became pharaoh around 1390 B.C. when he was 10 to 12 years old; he married Tiye, who was around the same age, shortly thereafter. He proceeded to marry many more women, forging political alliances that brought Egypt wealth and strategic military alliances. Many of his wives were of noble birth, including the daughter of the King of Babylon; however, Tiye, with her charm and beauty, was Amenhotep's favorite wife and his principal queen. She would hold the position as the Great Royal Spouse of Amenhotep III for nearly 50 years. Because Amenhotep held Tiye in such high esteem, he proclaimed her an equal of a king -- the first time a nonroyal had achieved such status. She was also the first queen depicted on even par with her husband in royal portraits. </p><p> Tiye's husband showed her his affection in many unique ways. He had her accompany him to many events, even though royal protocol called for Amenhotep's mother, the carrier of the royal bloodline, to accompany him to certain official ceremonies. (One can only imagine how his mother felt about having to share her time and the attention of the masses with her daughter-in-law from Nubian origins.) He built Tiye a gorgeous barge, the Splendor-of-Aten, then dug an artificial lake so she could float the craft for special ceremonies, fireworks, or whatever pleasure she desired. He also commissioned for her a great complex of structures in western Thebes; it is believed Tiye resided in the southeast quarter of the complex in what is called the South Palace. Amenhotep went even further by erecting a splendid temple dedicated to her worship in the Nubian city of Sedeinga, on the west bank of the Nile in present-day Sudan. </p><p> Amenhotep loved and trusted Tiye so much, and so respected her intellectual capabilities, that he considered her a trusted advisor and confidante in affairs of state. He often left her in charge while he traveled on missions to increase Egypt's honor; his faith in her judgment was proven correct time and again when she ruled alone for long stints. </p><p> When Amenhotep died in 1353 B.C., Tiye's power and influence did not end as was the case for many previous queens. In fact, when Tiye's son Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV) took the throne, she became secretary of state, a position second only to the pharaoh. Leaders from other countries routinely conferred with Tiye on matters regarding international relations, remembering and respecting her earlier actions as queen to Amenhotep. Tushratta, King of Mitanni, beseeched Tiye to influence Akhenaten to honor the agreements made between himself and Amenhotep: "You are the on[e, on the other ha]nd, who knows much better than all others the things [that] we said [to one an]other. No one [el]se knows them (as well)." Eager to continue the goodwill between their two kingdoms, he added "You must keep on send[ing] embassies of joy, one after another. Do not cut [them] off." Tiye served as the liaison between the courts at Thebes and Amarna, Akhenaten's new capital. Meanwhile, Akhenaten, encouraged by his mother, preoccupied himself with religious reform, proclaiming for the first time in human history the idea of a single god. He named Aten, the solar disk and a lesser god to Amun-Re, the supreme deity. He devoted himself to his beliefs and the building of Amarna, which would be the center of worship for Aten. Tiye died around 1340 B.C., but her groundbreaking accomplishments in matters of royalty and affairs of state live on. </p><p> Just as Egypt claims Tiye as a queen, Ethiopia claims Makeda, the Queen of Sheba, as one of its own. Makeda (or Bilqis as she is known in the Islamic world) is considered by Ethiopians to be the mother of the Ethiopian royal bloodline that commenced in the tenth century B.C. and continued to modern times. </p><p> The story of Makeda is written in the Bible, the Koran, and the <i>Kebra Negast (Glory of Kings,</i> an Ethiopian epic), each with subtle variations. According to legend, Queen Makeda learned of the wisdom of Jerusalem's King Solomon from a merchant prince named Tamrin, who had been engaging in trade with that king. Old Testament scripture states in I Kings that when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she decided to prove him with hard questions. She set out to see the king, carrying with her an abundance of gold and spices. Like any visiting dignitary, Makeda did not want to arrive empty-handed. Her gifts were both an offering of peace and a demonstration of her prosperity. The Song of Solomon in the Bible has Makeda allegedly saying upon her arrival, "I am black but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem." </p><p> King Solomon loved women and reportedly had a harem of more than 600 wives and concubines. He was instantly struck by Makeda's beauty and wished to claim her for his own; however, the Queen of Sheba was bound to chastity. So enthralled was Solomon by the Black queen that he respected her wishes. Still, he seldom left her side. He lavished her with feasts during which the two of them dined and talked every night until dawn; he commissioned for her an apartment made of crystal and had a throne for her placed at his side. For six months Makeda witnessed his decisions, actions, and interactions with his people. Only then, as said in I Kings 10: 6-7, was she convinced of his wisdom: </p><p><br> <i>And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. </i></p><p><i> Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard. </i> </p><p><br> Then, according to the <i>Kebra Negast,</i> she announced that it was time to return to Ethiopia and her people. They needed her. Her announcement saddened Solomon; he had hoped to convince her to consummate their union, for he very much desired a son born of this strong, intelligent, and beautiful woman. </p><p> The <i>Kebra Negast</i> relates that King Solomon created a situation to fulfill his dearest wish. He made Makeda's final night more festive than all the previous days and nights she had spent in Jerusalem. He lavished her with everything that his royal throne could summon. Fiercely attracted to Solomon, Makeda's resolve finally crumbled, and she welcomed the king into her bed. The next day, Solomon supposedly gave Makeda 6,000 chariots laden with gifts, and a vessel that traveled in the air. Upon returning home, Makeda learned she was carrying Solomon's child; she named him Menilek, the Son of Wisdom, to honor his father. </p><p> When Menilek reached manhood, Makeda gave him a ring and told him to seek his father in Jerusalem. The young man did as his mother requested. Legend says that Menilek spent time with his father, learning from his wisdom. Eventually the young man returned to his mother's people in Ethiopia, having been anointed a king in Jerusalem, to found the Solomonic dynasty. The wisdom and intelligence of both his parents was evident in his reign. W...</p>A compendium of critical female figures from the African Diaspora is an excellent idea; the book succeeds in offering a range of biographies, from Hatshepsut of Egypt-who was wed to her half-brother and later usurped his throne-through Mary Todd Lincoln's dressmaker to Anita Hill. Unfortunately, flat-footed writing undermines 150 information-rich photos and illustrations. Carter, director of development at Howard University, drops her subjects into a formula, citing the circumstances of their birth and then offering a general, platitudinous remark-"Life was anything but easy for Angelou." Often, the subjects' achievements are also rendered in broad strokes, without detail or narrative intrigue: "[The Pharaoh] often left [Queen Tiye] in charge when he traveled... his faith in her judgment was proven time and again when she ruled alone for long stints." At best, the reader's interest is piqued but not satisfied. At worst, the reader may be baffled. About Tina Turner, Carter writes, "Turner overcame her obstacle as an abused woman, finding overwhelming success in music, movies, and the world of beauty products." Perhaps if the conception of the work hadn't been such a good one, the reader would not be as frustrated to see the vibrant, complex women of the diaspora flattened out by tired language. In its effort to be accessible and inspiring, the book is in danger of robbing its subjects of the revolutionary qualities that make them most interesting. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Oklahoma City: What the Investigation Missed--and Why It Still Matters</h2><p><p><em>Oklahoma City</em> is a riveting account of one of the deadliest acts of terrorism on American soil, combining groundbreaking investigative research with a thrilling and true conspiracy story that has implications for national security and law enforcement today.</p><p>April 19, 1995: Timothy McVeigh drove into downtown Oklahoma City in a rented Ryder truck containing a fertilizer bomb that he and his army buddy Terry Nichols had made the previous day.

Charles is a riveting piece of journalism and a cautionary tale for our times.</p></p><p><p>In the early morning of April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh drove into downtown Oklahoma City in a rented Ryder truck containing a deadly fertilizer bomb that he and his army buddy Terry Nichols had made the previous day. He parked in a handicapped-parking zone, hopped out of the truck, and walked away into a series of alleys and streets. Shortly after 9:00 A.M., the bomb obliterated one-third of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people, including 19 infants and toddlers. McVeigh claimed he'd worked only with Nichols, and at least officially, the government believed him. But McVeigh's was just one version of events. And much of it was wrong.</p><p>In <em>Oklahoma City,</em> veteran investigative journalists Andrew Gumbel and Roger G. Charles puncture the myth about what happened on that day&#x2014;one that has persisted in the minds of the American public for nearly two decades. Working with unprecedented access to government documents, a voluminous correspondence with Terry Nichols, and more than 150 interviews with those immediately involved, Gumbel and Charles demonstrate how much was missed beyond the guilt of the two principal defendants: in particular, the dysfunction within the country's law enforcement agencies, which squandered opportunities to penetrate the radical right and prevent the bombing, and the unanswered question of who inspired the plot and who else might have been involved.</p><p>To this day, the FBI heralds the Oklahoma City investigation as one of its great triumphs. In reality, though, its handling of the bombing foreshadowed many of the problems that made the country vulnerable to attack again on 9/11. Law enforcement agencies could not see past their own rivalries and underestimated the seriousness of the deadly rhetoric coming from the radical far right. In <em>Oklahoma City</em>, Gumbel and Charles give the fullest, most honest account to date of both the plot and the investigation, drawing a vivid portrait of the unfailingly compelling&#x2014;driven, eccentric, fractious, funny, and wildly paranoid&#x2014;characters involved.</p><p>Andrew Gumbel has worked for more than twenty years as a foreign correspondent for British newspapers. He has won awards for investigative reporting and political commentary, and written widely for U.S. publications including the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> and <em>The Atlantic</em>.

Combining 175 color photographs shot throughout France with an informative text, <i>The Art of French Vegetable Gardening</i> explains how to create different styles of decorative vegetable gardens, from the strict geometries of formal tradition to the happy-intermingling of vegetables with flowers, herbs, and fruit trees beloved by organic gardeners. Each chapter offers useful advice and suggestions&#x2014;applicable to gardens anywhere&#x2014;while evoking the rich cultural context of the French potager as lovingly described by Colette, Proust, Gertrude Stein, and many others. <p> Elements of garden design&#x2014;including layout, hedging, walls, benches, and vertical accents&#x2014;are detailed, as are specific vegetables that can provide both beauty and flavor. Other topics include companion planting using herbs and flowers, heirloom and collectors' varieties, and even the vegetable garden in winter. An extensive appendix offers 80 classic Frnech recipes for vegetables, lists of plants American seed sources, and French vegetable gardens open to the public. Practical as well as beautiful, <i>The Art of French Vegetable Gardening</i> is an invaluable sourcebook to return to again and again.</p><p></p></p><p>Louisa Jones and her husband began gardening in southern France after buying an old farmstead surrounded by vineyards and fruit trees in 1975. Her exploration of the surrounding region led to her first book, <i>Garderns of Provence</i>, in 1992, followed by <i>Provence: A Country Almanac, Gardens of the French Riviera</i>, and <i>The New Provencal Cuisine</i>. Now she has enlarged her scope to all of France, exploring each region's traditions in the art of vegetable gardening.Jones (Gardens of Provence, Abbeville, 1992) has been gardening in France since 1975. Here she presents the potager (the kitchen garden or vegetable plot) as an art form, with culinary use as a secondary consideration. Alluding to garden references by Colette, Henry James, Rousseau, and others, she discusses vegetable gardens in the dimensions of space and time. Jones explains that French gardens are enclosed by walls or hedges and lined with espaliered fruit trees or vines; pathways establish the outlines, with water and vertical features filling in. Appendixes give ideas for designing a potager, seed sources, public gardens, books consulted, and recipe suggestions. Equally important are the 175 full-color photographs, which are simply gorgeous. Le Scanff and Mayer have been photographing gardens for 20 years, and their work appears regularly in European gardening and food magazines.

After fighting side by side for nearly four years, their political alliance was rapidly fracturing. By the time the leaders met again in Potsdam in July 1945, Russians and Americans were squabbling over the future of Germany and Churchill was warning about an &#x201c;iron curtain&#x201d; being drawn down over the Continent.<br><br> These six months witnessed some of the most dramatic moments of the twentieth century: the cataclysmic battle for Berlin, the death of Franklin Roosevelt, the discovery of the Nazi concentration camps, Churchill&#x2019;s electoral defeat, and the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan. While their armies linked up in the heart of Europe, the political leaders maneuvered for leverage: Stalin using his nation&#x2019;s wartime sacrifices to claim spoils, Churchill doing his best to halt Britain&#x2019;s waning influence, FDR trying to charm Stalin, Truman determined to stand up to an increasingly assertive Soviet superpower.<br><br> <i>Six Months in 1945</i> brilliantly captures this momentous historical turning point, chronicling the geopolitical twists behind the descent of the iron curtain, while illuminating the aims and personalities of larger-than-life political giants. It is a vividly rendered story of individual and national interests in fierce competition at a seminal moment in history.</p><p><p><b>Guest Review: Author Rick Atkinson on <em>Six Months in 1945</em></b></p> <p><strong>Rick Atkinson, recipient of the 2010 Pritzker Military Library Literature Award for Lifetime Achievement in Military Writing, is the bestselling author of <em>The Day of Battle</em>,<em> An Army at Dawn, The Long Gray Line</em>, and <em>In the Company of Soldiers</em>. The final volume of his <em>Liberation Trilogy</em>, covering the last year of the European war, from Normandy to Berlin, will be published in 2013. Atkinson was a staff writer and senior editor at <em>The Washington Post</em> for twenty years, and his many awards include Pulitzer Prizes for journalism and history. He lives in Washington, D.C.</strong></p> <p>By February 1945, when Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston S. Churchill, and Joseph Stalin met at the Crimean resort of Yalta, the Grand Alliance had become the most successful military coalition in modern history. The Big Three, with help from lesser allies among what Roosevelt called the united nations, had nearly obliterated the fascist Axis. The German Reich had but three months left to live, the Japanese regime barely twice that. In the three years since the Allies had formally made common cause, they had won great victories on three continents and the high seas, liberating the Mediterranean, most of Europe, and much of Asia from Axis oppression, and all but ending, righteously, a catastrophe that would cost sixty million dead worldwide.</p> <p>Six months after the triumphant gathering at Yalta, the war-winning alliance had largely come unglued. Collaboration against the existential threat of fascist totalitarianism was supplanted by mutual suspicion and recrimination. Blood allies had become geopolitical rivals, if not blood enemies. The long, sanguinary war would become a long, fraught, dangerous peace.</p> <p>Michael Dobbs tells this story with panache, lucidity, and exceptional scholarship. <em>Six Months in 1945 </em>ably sketches the big arrows on the map, showing how the concluding chapters of World War II became the opening chapters of the Cold War, shaping the world we inhabit today. Characters long dead return to life, not just the obvious architects of Allied victory, but vivid, vital, less well-known figures whom Dobbs deftly rescues from obscurity. From Yalta to Potsdam, the tale is told with authority and clarity, drawing on memoirs, archives, and a wealth of other sources, including many in Russian.</p> <p>The bevy of books on the end of the war and its immediate aftermath, large and impressive though it may be, is enriched by <em>Six Months in 1945.</em></p>Michael Dobbs was born and educated in Britain, with fellowships at Princeton and Harvard universities. Now a U.S. citizen, he spent much of his career as a reporter for <i>The Washington Post</i>, for which he covered the collapse of communism. <i>Six Months in 1945</i> completes a Cold War trilogy that also includes <i>One Minute to Midnight</i>, on the Cuban missile crisis, and <i>Down with Big Brother</i>, on the final collapse of the Soviet Empire. &nbsp;Dobbs lives in Bethesda, Maryland.</p><h2>Jesus in Blue Jeans: A Practical Guide to Everyday Spirituality</h2><p>The sequel to <em>Jesus, CEO</em> draws on the New Testament to reveal how the life and ministry of Jesus Christ is relevant in the modern world, presenting a daily course of reflective action to help readers put spirituality to practical use in every aspect of work and daily life."</p><p>In 1995, Laurie Beth Jones released <i>Jesus CEO</i>, the first book in a trilogy that traces her own journey from well-pressed executive through a season of personal self- examination, ending finally in blue jeans, having found her heart's true home. <i>The Path</i> is the second book and helps readers identify their divine purpose in life. Her final book, <i>Jesus in Blue Jeans</i>, answers a request: "Could you write a book that could help me with my everyday life?"<p> Beginning with the proposition that Jesus had an everyday life, Laurie Beth Jones explores the four fundamental qualities of Jesus that we can emulate in our everyday lives: poise, perspective, passion, and power. We investigate the everyday challenges common to all of us, using Jesus' life as our model. Each chapter includes a meditation and teaching, and closes with question to challenge and motivate us. She doesn't intend that we remain passive spectators, rather that we embrace life and participate fully.</p><p> Jones has a special gift for presenting the teachings of Jesus in ways that are at once practical and transcendent. By writing about subjects that are familiar to all of us, she makes us comfortable with exploring this unfamiliar ground. Once we feel safe, she quietly steps aside, shifting our attention from our own anxieties to the wisdom of Jesus. The result is an openness and receptivity that might not have been possible for us before.</p><p> Jones removes Jesus from theology without sacrificing her own belief. Her love for God is evident and her life seems to overflow with love, enthusiasm, and joy. Moreover, she builds within the reader a curiosity or hunger that goes well beyond the covers of this book, giving the reader the incentive to explore Jesus for him- or herself, so that each experiences the grandeur of life. <i>--Patricia Klein</i></p>Laurie Beth Jones is the founder of the Jesus, CEO Foundation, a non-profit organization.</p><h2>Meaning of Jesus, The</h2><p><p>Was Jesus born of a virgin? Did he know he was the Messiah? Was he bodily resurrected from the dead? Did he intentionally die to redeem humankind? Was Jesus God? </p><p> In <em>The Meaning of Jesus</em> two leading Jesus scholars with widely divergent views go right to the heart of these questions and others, presenting the opposing visions of Jesus that shape our faith today. </p><p> In alternating chapters, Marcus Borg, the most popular revisionist voice on Jesus and a member of the Jesus Seminar, and N. T. Wright, the most prominent standard&#x2013;bearer for the traditional stance and an outspoken critic of the Jesus Seminar, present their views of who Jesus was, what he taught, and what he did. </p><p> Candid, spirited, and thoughtfully debated, this compelling discourse will stimulate fresh ideas and intense dialogue among anyone concerned with what it means to be a Christian today. </p></p><p><i>The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions</i> is a theological remix of the old Cole Porter song "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off." In alternating chapters, the (mostly) liberal Marcus J. Borg and the (mostly) conservative N.T. Wright consider the major questions of the historical-Jesus debate that has dominated biblical studies in the 1990s. Borg and Wright agree that Jesus was the Christian messiah and preached the Kingdom of God, but they disagree about the Virgin birth, the purpose of Jesus' death, the issue of his bodily resurrection, and the question of his divinity. The Ping-Pong structure of this book and the fastidious politeness with which the authors treat one another sometimes give <i>The Meaning of Jesus</i> a tomato/tomahto, potato/potahto bounciness, but the project is nevertheless worthy: this is a simple, clear orientation to some of the most important biblical questions of our time, and a record of a lively and loving friendship between two of the best Christian scholars alive. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>Marcus J. Borg is canon theologian at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Portland, Oregon, and was Hundere Distinguished Professor of Religion and Culture at Oregon State University. Described by the <em>New York Times</em> as "a leading figure in his generation of Jesus scholars," he has appeared on NBC's <em>The Today Show</em> and <em>Dateline</em>, ABC's <em>World News</em>, and NPR's <em>Fresh Air</em>.

Just before the Second World War the Durrell family decamped to the glorious, sun-soaked island of Corfu where the youngest of the four children, ten-year-old Gerald, discovered his passion for animals: toads and tortoises, bats and butterflies, scorpions and octopuses. Through glorious silver-green olive groves and across brilliant-white beaches Gerry pursued his obsession . . . causing hilarity and mayhem in his ever-tolerant family.</p><p>Gerald Durrell was born in Jamshedpur, India, in 1925. He returned to England in 1928 before settling on the island of Corfu with his family. In 1945 he joined the staff of Whipsnade Park as a student keeper, and in 1947 he led his first animal-collecting expedition to the Cameroons. He later undertook numerous further expeditions, visiting Paraguay, Argentina, Sierra Leone, Mexico, Mauritius, Assam and Madagascar. His first television programme, Two in the Bush� which documented his travels to New Zealand, Australia and Malaya was made in 1962; he went on to make seventy programmes about his trips around the world. In 1959 he founded the Jersey Zoological Park, and in 1964 he founded the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust. He was awarded the OBE in 1982. Encouraged to write about his life&#39;s work by his brother, Durrell published his first book, The Overloaded Ark, in 1953. It soon became a bestseller and he went on to write thirty-six other titles, including My Family and Other Animals, The Bafut Beagles, Encounters with Animals, The Drunken Forest, A Zoo in My Luggage, The Whispering Land, Menagerie Manor, The Amateur Naturalist and The Aye-Aye and I.

Using everything from acorns to zippers, artist Joan Steiner has created stunning three-dimensional scenes that will amaze and captivate puzzlers of all ages.</p><p>"Come along! Jump aboard! Grab hold of my hand. / We're crossing the border into Look-Alike Land." So invites the opening lines of Joan Steiner's <i>Look-Alikes</i>, a three-dimensional miniature metropolis that's meticulously, ingeniously crafted out of everyday objects from mousetraps to milk bones. At first glance, a fancy hotel lobby seems just that, but take a closer look and you'll see a sofa made of gloves. In a sunny street scene, a building fa�ade is laden with crackers, crayons form fence posts, and the tree is shaded by a stalk of broccoli. Children and adults alike will love poring over each picture, most of which contain more than 100 objects cleverly arranged to delight and deceive. Kids will easily identify many household objects, and the ones they may not recognize--a hosiery garter or flour sifter, for example--they'll learn from either the guide in the back or from a helpful parent. Good humor, a keen eye, and hours of hard work went into this visual marvel, which should be equally captivating for artists and I Spy fans. (Ages 5 to 105) <i>--Karin Snelson</i><p>GET TO KNOW JOAN STEINER, THE MIND BEHIND THE FANTASTIC CREATIONS IN LOOK-ALIKES (tm) </p><p>Q. How did you come to be a three-dimensional artist? </p><p>After I had been out of college for several years knocking around from one job to another that I didn't find satisfying, it occurred to me that I should try to make a career out of the thing I loved best (art) even if I had to do something fairly lowly in that field. That's how I began, and I turned out to be a little more talented than I expected. I discovered that the thing one loves best is likely to be the thing one does best. </p><p>Q. How did you decide to translate your art into a picture book format? </p><p>I loved doing these puzzles, and had been doing them for several years, but there were limited uses for them in terms of magazines and posters. A friend suggested that I try making a picture book incorporating my puzzles. But it took a long time to come up with a concept that would tie it all together. Then I came up with the idea of visiting a land where everything looked like something else. </p><p>Q. How long does it take for you to construct each scene? </p><p>It took me three and one half years total to complete the book, and each scene took several months to create. Some scenes took longer than others - like the train and the city scenes took forever because I was still working out the ideas while I put it together. I kept making them more intricate than I originally envisioned. </p><p>Q. How do you find the things you use in your creations? </p><p>Mostly by shopping! But it is not ordinary shopping. My projects take me to all different kinds of stores and other places too, like hardware stores, party stores, thrift shops, brickyards and art stores. I can spend four to six hours in one big store (very tiring!), slowly going up and down the aisles looking for ideas or for specific objects. I may spend ten minutes carefully looking at a mousetrap, turning it from side to side and upside down, thinking about whether it's something I can use. No wonder I attract the attention of store detectives! </p><p>I will go great lengths to get just the right item. For the circus scene, I decided I wanted to make the tent out of trench coat. I couldn't afford to buy a new trench coat just to make a tent out of it, so I visited a lot of thrift shops and Salvation Army stores. Of course you can't always tell what will work until you try it out, so I wound up buying several. Now I have a trenchcoat collection. </p><p>Q. What is the most unusual object you have incorporated into your art? </p><p>There is a hand grenade in the general store - that is probably the most unusual. Also cheese doodle are very challenging, and hard to glue!</p></p><h2>The Happiness Trap - Stop Struggling, Start Living</h2><p>Are you, like milllions of Americans, caught in the happiness trap? Russ Harris explains that the way most of us go about trying to find happiness ends up making us miserable, driving the epidemics of stress, anxiety, and depression. This empowering book presents&nbsp; the insights and techniques of ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) a revolutionary new psychotherapy based on cutting-edge research in behavioral psychology. By clarifying your values and developing mindfulness (a technique for living fully in the present moment), ACT helps you escape the happiness trap and find true satisfaction in life. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The techniques presented in <i>The Happiness Trap</i> will help readers to: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Reduce stress and worry <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Handle painful feelings and thoughts more effectively <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Break self-defeating habits <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Overcome insecurity and self-doubt <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Create a rich, full, and meaningful life</p><p>Dr. Russ Harris is a physician, therapist, and speaker specializing in stress management. He travels nationally and internationally to train individuals and health professionals in the techniques of ACT. Born and educated in England, he now lives in Australia. For more information, visit actmindfully.com.au.Physician Harris challenges some basic assumptions about the all-American tradition of the pursuit of happiness, drawing heavily on the acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) work of University of Nevada professor Steven Hayes, which argues that happiness is not a normal state of being; pain is inevitable and what matters is how it is dealt with. The ACT prescription is to be mindful of negative thoughts and emotions, reconnect with core values, act in accordance with values and with the psychological flexibility to adapt to any situation. ACT techniques include diffusion&#x2014;decreasing the impact of self-defeating thoughts (without making them go away), turning off the struggle switch, practicing expansion to make room for self-observation and connecting with the present moment. While these concepts might sound like typical self-help fare, Harris makes key distinctions: ACT is not a form of meditation or a path to enlightenment&#x2014;to reap the benefits, action is imperative. More of an ACT primer than anything else, there's enough interesting content here to keep the reader, um, happy. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It&#x2019;s the height of the historical battle in the Upper Peninsula&#x2019;s Garden Peninsula. The Garden had always been a lawless place. In the 1970s, armed fishermen claimed their takes and to hell with law enforcement. The renegades far outgunned the COs, who risked their lives attempting to enforce limits. Service goes undercover to expose the leaders of the Garden revolt. He&#x2019;s as good as dead.

Tour.</p><p>Mary Pipher, author of the bestselling and groundbreaking <i>Reviving Ophelia</i>, which charts the troubled passage of girls into adolescence, has nimbly covered yet another psychological passage: that into old age, which May Sarton called "a foreign country." <p> Pipher reveals that the greatest shame for today's elders--most of whom survived the Depression--is not being self-sufficient. The majority of them stoically prefer to keep their feelings to themselves, and this is why it's so difficult to convince older parents to accept or even discuss such issues as physical and mental health, finances, eldercare, or living wills. This directly conflicts with the openness of their children, who grew up in the era of "free love" and were influenced by society (and the advent of psychology in the 1950s and popularization of therapy) to talk frankly about emotions. While a boomer can easily talk with a friend about marriage difficulties or even surgery, an elder is likely to find admitting such "weaknesses" abhorrent. </p><p> <i>Another Country</i> includes excerpts of sessions with dozens of Pipher's psychology patients, interspersed with not-so-obvious advice for sensitively communicating with the elderly. Some interviews are grim: one woman hallucinated that rodents were running through her house; she was so desperate for company from her family, but too proud to ask them to stop by, that she invented her own visitors. But the breakthroughs in communication Pipher is able to accomplish, sometimes with the help of grandchildren as intermediaries, are startling and thoroughly encouraging. (For example, the animals the woman was imagining disappeared after she received company regularly.)</p><p> Pipher cared for her dying mother for a "horrid," guilt-filled year while this book was being written and says that she wanted "to help others in my situation feel less alone." She also aims to help each generation understand the other. In these goals she's succeeded brilliantly. Any adult struggling with issues with their parents, especially mortality, will find <i>Another Country</i> an indispensable source of suggestions and support. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p>Mary Pipher's third New York Times bestseller -- a book about us and our parents . . .<p>There are more older people in America today than ever before. They are our parents and grandparents, our aunts and uncles and in-laws. They are living longer, but in a culture that has come to worship youth -- a culture in which families have dispersed, communities have broken down, and older people are isolated. Meanwhile, adults in two-career families are struggling to divide their time among their kids, their jobs, and their aging parents -- searching for the right words to talk about loneliness, forgetfulness, or selling the house.</p><p>Another Country is a field guide to this rough terrain for a generation of baby boomers who are finding themselves unprepared to care for those who have always cared for them. Psychologist and bestselling writer Mary Pipher maps out strategies that help bridge the gaps that separate us from our elders. And with her inimitable combination of respect and realism, she offers us new ways of supporting each other -- new ways of sharing our time, our energy, and our love.</p></p><h2>A Caribbean Mystery (Miss Marple Mysteries)</h2><p>While vacationing on St. Honore, Miss Marple is accosted by a strange man who offers to show her the picture of a murderer and is found dead the next day, prompting Miss Marple to delve into the mystery.

Great love or loyalty, enthusiasm, or zeal. 2. Religious worship. 3. Prayers. <p>You know a lot about the Catholic Church, or maybe you are just learning, but there are things that confuse you&#x2014;like what to do when you pray a novena, or how to "offer up" something, exactly what the Angelus is, or any of the dozens of other devotions that set Catholics apart from other Christians. But help is here! The How-To Book of Catholic Devotions is the only book that not only provides the who, what, where, when, and why of the most time-honored traditions of the Church but also the how. In this complete guide you get: </p><p>� step-by-step guidelines to all the devotional rites and rituals of the Catholic Faith </p><p>� a history of each devotion and a reflection on its importance in the prayer life of Catholics </p><p>� succinct and salient quotes from saints and prominent members of the Church </p><p>� cautions, drawn from Scripture and Tradition, for potential temptations and distractions </p><p>� the blessings and graces associated with the devotions </p><p>If you want to learn what devotions comprise a truly Catholic life&#x2014;and share those practices with others&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t be without The How-To Book of Catholic Devotions. </p><p>Now discover how to: </p><p>� Pray the Sign of the Cross, Morning Offering, Grace Before Meals, Acts of Faith, Hope, and Love, and many more </p><p>� Pray the Angelus </p><p>� Make First Fridays and First Saturdays </p><p>� Make a novena </p><p>� "Offer up" something </p><p>� Pray the Rosary </p><p>� Read the Bible </p><p>� Practice mental prayer </p><p>� Examine your conscience </p><p>� Fast and abstain </p><p>� Pray with sacred images </p><p>� Consecrate your life to the Sacred Heart of Jesus or the Immaculate Heart of Mary </p><p>� Make a pilgrimage </p><p>� Wear a scapular </p><p>"This charming book shows you how to plunge in and do all the things devout Catholics do. Learning to pray in Catholic ways, learning to use Catholic things like scapulars and blessings and holy water, and learning to eat fish on Friday while knowing why -- all this amounts to more than one might think. Learning the practices of faith is learning faith again, and remembering why faith is so human and so sacred, and so dear to us."-- Fr. Ronald Lawler, O.F.M. Cap. Member, Pontifical Roman Theological Academy</p></p><p>From the Angelus to First Fridays, vigil candles to novenas, Catholic practice of time-honored Church traditions can be confusing. <p>For years, The How-To-Book of Catholic Devotions provided clarity and inspiration for the dozens of devotions that enliven and deepen the faith of Catholics. Now, the Second Edition offers even more to love in an updated text that includes: The Divine Mercy ChapletA section on St. FaustinaThe Luminous MysteriesUpdated information on technology that supports Catholic devotionUpdated prayers, examination of conscience, spiritual direction, and Marian consecrationMany more resources</p><p>Scapulars, pilgrimages, fasting and abstinence, the Rosary, prayer, sacred images learn about these subjects and many more, along with the graces and blessings associated with them, in The How-To-Book of Catholic Devotions, Second Edition.</p>Catholics could enrich their spiritual lives immeasurably by rediscovering their legacy of devotions, contend Aquilina (author of five previous books for OSV) and Flaherty (executive director of the Archdiocese of Boston Catholic Cemeteries). The authors' enthusiasm for their subject is admirable. They cover various practices--including meditation, the rosary and confession--but such ambitious scope limits the reader's full appreciation of each practice. The reader's cursory comprehension of these devotions is further hindered by the book's awkward narrative structure. Each chapter highlights several practices by describing a prayer, offering a reflection and including quotations from notable Catholics about the prayer. The authors miss chances to connect devotion to devotion. For example, the section on "How to Pray an Aspiration" (a short prayer that glorifies God) follows the section "How to Meditate" without explaining whether these practices should be independent of, or foster, each other. The final chapter focuses on the necessary ingredients of a good spiritual life: making a spiritual plan, finding direction and living one's faith. Aquilina and Flaherty are at their best here--perhaps this should have been their starting point. The book's curiously abrupt ending demonstrates its narrative problems most plainly, leaving the reader to tie up loose ends. Despite good intentions, this manual will most likely miss the opportunity to recapture Catholics' enthusiasm for their rich spiritual heritage. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The New Science of Getting Rich</h2><p>Straightforward and easy to understand, <i>The Science of Getting Rich</i> asserts that all of us -- no matter what our circumstances -- have the ability to obtain enough wealth to live as we desire and to fulfill our purpose in life. <br> <br> Written nearly a century ago and recently rediscovered by Rhonda Byrne, creator of <i>The Secret, The Science of Getting Rich</i> offers clear insight on creating prosperity and the happiness that ensues. <br> <br> There exists a science of getting rich -- and it is an exact science, like algebra or arithmetic. There are also certain laws that govern the process of acquiring means, and once these laws are learned and followed, a person will prosper with mathematical certainty. This book carefully provides the explanation of this science and how these laws function. <br> <br> Each one of us naturally wants to achieve his or her full potential -- this desire to realize our innate talents is inherent in human nature. There is nothing wrong in wanting to become wealthy; in fact, the longing for riches is really the desire for a fuller and more abundant life. <i>The Science of Getting Rich</i> can set you on your way toward reaching this goal.</p><p>This classic Wallace D. Wattles title has often been compared to Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, and many believe they act as excellent companion titles. Individuals who have read books by Robert Allen, Suze Orman or David Bach will find often find this title to as well be of interest.The man who owns all he wants for the living of all the life he is capable of living is rich; and no man who has not plenty of money can have all he wants. Life has advanced so far, and become so complex, that even the most ordinary man or woman requires a great amount of wealth in order to live in a manner that even approaches completeness. Every person naturally wants to become all that they are capable of becoming; this desire to realize innate possibilities is inherent in human nature; we cannot help wanting to be all that we can be. Success in life is becoming what you want to be; you can become what you want to be only by making use of things, and you can have the free use of things only as you become rich enough to buy them. To understand the science of getting rich is therefore the most essential of all knowledge. <p>In writing this book I have sacrificed all other considerations to plainness and simplicity of style, so that all might understand. The plan of action laid down herein was deduced from the conclusions of philosophy; it has been thoroughly tested, and bears the supreme test of practical experiment; it works. If you wish to know how the conclusions were arrived at, read the writings of the authors mentioned above; and if you wish to reap the fruits of their philosophies in actual practice, read this book and do exactly as it tells you to do.</p></p><h2>Spontaneous Healing: How to Discover and Enhance: Your Body&#39;s Natural Ability to Maintain and Heal Itself</h2><p>One of the most authoritative and important voices on health and healing today presents a powerful new concept--that the body has within it a healing system, responsible not only for remissions of life-threatening diseases but also for day-to-day maintenance and for positive responses to everyday illnesses.</p><p>It is clear that all organisms have highly developed mechanisms for self-repair and healing -- but according to Dr. Weil, Western medicine often interferes instead of working with these systems. In the course of his argument, he describes several extraordinary case studies of drastic spontaneous healing. Perhaps the most valuable feature of the book is his more gradual eight-week program of strengthening the ability of your immune, endocrine, circulatory, and nervous systems to provide such spontaneous healing.I think my mother is the long lost sister of Dr. Andrew Weil, author of Spontaneous Healing. As children, my brothers and sisters and I went to the doctor only for yearly check-ups. If we had a cough or cold, we would not be rushed to the doctor's office. For a few days we were treated with orange juice, chicken noodle soup, Vicks Vapo-Rub and TLC, until our bodies recovered, and this turned into our one illness of the year. A lot of my friends, however, who were always being rushed to the doctor, were also always being diagnosed with something or other and spent the winter months on antibiotics. Was I just generally more healthy? Maybe. But it seems now that to some extent my mother was mirroring the teachings of Dr. Weil, and letting our bodies respond to whatever was making us sick. <br>-- JMC</p><h2>Lethal White (A Cormoran Strike Novel, 4)</h2><p><b>"Rowling's wizardry as a writer is on fulsome display" (<i>USA Today</i>) in this #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller from the international bestselling author Robert Galbraith.</b><br>When Billy, a troubled young man, comes to private eye Cormoran Strike's office to ask for his help investigating a crime he thinks he witnessed as a child, Strike is left deeply unsettled. While Billy is obviously mentally distressed, and cannot remember many concrete details, there is something sincere about him and his story. But before Strike can question him further, Billy bolts from his office in a panic.<br>Trying to get to the bottom of Billy's story, Strike and Robin Ellacott-once his assistant, now a partner in the agency-set off on a twisting trail that leads them through the backstreets of London, into a secretive inner sanctum within Parliament, and to a beautiful but sinister manor house deep in the countryside.<br>And during this labyrinthine investigation, Strike's own life is far from straightforward: his newfound fame as a private eye means he can no longer operate behind the scenes as he once did. Plus, his relationship with his former assistant is more fraught than it ever has been-Robin is now invaluable to Strike in the business, but their personal relationship is much, much trickier than that.<br>The most epic Robert Galbraith novel yet, <i>Lethal White</i> is both a gripping mystery and a page-turning next instalment in the ongoing story of Cormoran Strike and Robin Ellacott.<br></p><p><b>Robert Galbraith </b>is a pseudonym for J.K.

Are you sick of being told by someone you love that you are "too sensitive"? Do you struggle to respect a less sensitive partner, to ignore behaviors that you find shallow or harsh? Or have you given up on love, feeling too sensitive or shy to endure its wounds? <br> <br>Research finds that 50 percent of what determines divorce is genetic temperament--or rather, according to Elaine Aron, ignorance about how partners should understand each other's temperaments. The risk of an unhappy relationship is especially high if you are one of the 20 percent born highly sensitive. Your fine-tuned nervous system, which picks up on subtleties and reflects deeply, would be ideal if both you and your partner understood you better. But without that understanding, your sensitivity is likely to be making your close relationships painful and complicated. <br> <br>So what's a highly sensitive person to do? Elaine N. Aron, Ph.D., a research psychologist and highly sensitive person herself, has taken a closer look at how inborn temperament affects intimacy. Based on her groundbreaking new research, <b>The Highly Sensitive Person in Love</b> offers practical help for highly sensitive people seeking happier, healthier romantic relationships. Every aspect of highly sensitive people in relationships is covered, from low-stress fighting to sensitive sexuality. Included are self-tests and case studies--and the results from the first survey ever done on sex and temperament.&nbsp;&nbsp;With wonderful advice on making the most of all personality combinations in relationships, Aron offers a wealth of insights for non-highly sensitive people as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what your relationship background, you will discover a better way of living and loving in <b>The Highly Sensitive Person in Love</b>.</p><p>Picking up where <i>The Highly Sensitive Person</i> left off, <i>The Highly Sensitive Person in Love</i> explores the sometimes bumpy but ultimately rewarding terrain that love relationships have to offer this group of people. HSPs, as they are known, make up the estimated 15 to 20 percent of the population that have very sensitive nervous system and are prone to deep reflection and feelings of being overwhelmed by the world. These special characteristics, which tend to be misunderstood as shyness and dismissed as signs of weakness in our highly competitive society, inevitably bring interesting challenges to all kinds of love relationships for HSPs. Author Elaine Aron--who's a psychotherapist, researcher, and an HSP--delves deep to into the subject and surfaces with detailed, helpful, wise advice for HSPs and their partners, be they fellow HSPs or non-HSPs. <p> Aron details the positive and negative sides to such relationships, including how the HSP benefits, how both members of the relationship benefit, the typical challenges that arise, and solutions to those challenges. For instance, a relationship made up of two HSPs may engender low levels of arousal, or awareness, which means that both of you will avoid doing the same things that make you uncomfortable, such as shopping, dealing with conflict, and being in crowds. Solution? Simplify your life, see if you can hire someone to take care of the tasks neither of you wants to do--but don't forget that doing such tasks is also a way to grow personally--and divvy up the tasks according to preference. As for conflict, Aron says that having a plan of action is the best route--decide how to handle conflict in the relationship before the conflict flares up. Another reality of an HSP-HSP union is that neither person will be able to max out on work and expect to have a decent home life, so at least one of you will have to limit activities. So, plan not to have more than one child if you both work (it may be too late for some couples to put this one into action; if so, Aron advises that one parent stay at home). </p><p> Throughout the book, Aron stresses that being in a relationship is a "package deal"; neither the HSP nor the non-HSP is perfect, so she urges readers to appreciate the positive aspects of their sensitivity, be it highly sensitive or not, and not to dwell on its drawbacks. But she does urge HSPs who are unhappy with their trait to work on coming to terms with it--through inner work, counseling, or medication if needed--as its qualities, when properly appreciated, can be life enhancing and beneficial to HSPs as well as to their relationship partners. <i>--Stefanie Durbin</i></p>?The Highly Sensitive Person in Love gives relationships their proper basis in the inner life, and honors those who are by nature drawn to that life.

Robyn and her husband live in Las Vegas, Nevada. You can visit Robyn Carr&#x2019;s website at www.RobynCarr.com.June stood in the shower a little longer than usual, preoccupied with a conversation she would have later in the day. She was the town doctor in Grace Valley, California, a post she had inherited from her father, Elmer "Doc" Hudson. Elmer was seventy-two and playing at retirement, which was a polite way of saying he didn't keep hours anymore but he stayed in his daughter's business all the time.<p>The need for another full-time doctor to serve the town was becoming more dire every day. June had already talked to several physicians, and so far there hadn't been a fortuitous match. But today John Stone, M.D., was going to interview. He was forty, had attended Stanford University and UCLA Medical, done his OB-GYN residency at Johns Hopkins, worked for eight years in a prestigious women's clinic, then done a second residency in family medicine. He was made to order for Grace Valley. But was Grace Valley made to order for him?</p><p>She tried to picture him, a yuppie from Sausalito. He had probably passed through town while on a wine tasting tour and begun fantasizing about the good life here. The beautiful landscape&#x2014;mountains, valley and ocean&#x2014; seduced more and more transplants from the cities every year. Or perhaps he'd been on a family vacation, doing the bed-and-breakfasts up the coast. But no, she thought, maybe a rich friend from San Francisco had a huge summer place nearby, someone who didn't need to eke out a living from the town. John Stone couldn't have been drawn here for golf or sailing; there was nothing so refined as that around. Hiking and camping, maybe, but only for a true woodsman. So what's he doing here? He'd <i>say </i>he was looking for peace and quiet and beauty and safety, all of which were plentiful in Grace Valley. Apple butter, heirloom quilts, unlocked doors, front porches and pies cooling in kitchen windows. Country life. Decency and simplicity.</p><p>He probably wanted to get his kids out of the dirty city, away from drugs and crime. How would he react to the news that the Coast Ranges and the Trinity Alps were so full of marijuana growers that army helicopters frequently flew just over the treetops, searching? The regular raids in the deep mountain forests made the simple sport of hiking a dangerous endeavor for the newcomer, since you never knew which camps and trails were controlled by drug farmers. Cannabis remained the largest cash crop in California. It was an uncomfortable reality, and it was just up the road.</p><p>As for peace and quiet, June was looking for a little of that herself. Her reason for trying to hire another physician. Obviously.</p><p>She turned off the water and began to towel her hair.</p><p>June had chosen to practice medicine in the small town she grew up in, <i>knowing </i>the challenge of it, knowing it could be more exciting than a city emergency room. She understood the inconvenience all too well&#x2014; she lived it&#x2014;and the sometimes discomfiting intimacy of being close friends with your patients, a thing big-city doctors could afford to avoid. So far all the medical contenders she had spoken to were trying to escape the hard work, long hours, overstimulation and constant demand of their city practices. Each had ultimately decided this wasn't the place for them, for it was a trade-off, one kind of pressure for another, but no less exacting. It took a certain personality to take on the medical needs of a whole town.</p><p>The phone rang. She glanced at the clock: 6:15.</p><p>That was another thing. There was no such thing as being "on call." There was you. Period.</p><p>She reached for the phone, but the damn cordless didn't work. Out of juice. She'd forgotten to plug it in again. With a towel wrapped loosely around her, and hair dripping in stringy tendrils to her shoulders, she made a dash for the kitchen phone.</p><p>The presence of strangers in the living room caused her to yelp in shocked surprise and dive behind the kitchen counter. Then she slowly rose and peeked over the counter into her small living room as the phone rang on. Had she really seen what she had seen? Four people...a man, a woman, two teenagers&#x2014;boy and girl. The woman had a horrible scar running down the left side of her face. It took June a second to realize it was an old wound; the family had not come for help with that. They sat on her sofa, nice as you please, not in any way alarmed by her state of undress.</p><p>The phone continued to ring as she peered over the counter.</p><p>"You the doctor?" the man finally asked.</p><p>"Um, yes. That would be me."</p><p>By their out-of-date clothing and questionable manners, June assumed they were from the backwoods&#x2014;subsistence farmers or mountain people. Since Grace Valley sat at the junction of three counties, it was impossible to tell which one they might be from. She didn't recognize these folks; maybe they'd never before sought medical treatment.</p><p>"Got a problem with the boy, here."</p><p>June tightened her towel and reached for the phone. "Excuse me," she said to the family. "I'll be with you in just a moment." She slid down behind the counter again. "Hello?" she said into the phone.</p><p>"Hi there," her father said. "I thought I'd better call and tell you that some family from back in Shell Mountain stopped George Fuller along the road and asked for directions to your house."</p><p>"Well, what the hell was George thinking?" she whispered fiercely.</p><p>"I don't imagine George thinks much if he can help it."</p><p>"They're here! Let themselves in and took a seat in the living room while I was in the shower!"</p><p>"Mercy. Well...would you like&#x2014;"</p><p>"I'm practically naked! I had to run to the kitchen phone, wearing only a towel!"</p><p>Elmer cackled, a laugh that had a slight wheeze to it, pipe smoking having taken its toll. "I bet they hadn't counted on that."</p><p>"I'm going to kill George!"</p><p>Elmer could hardly speak, he was laughing so hard. "Right now...I'll bet...you wish...you'd plugged in that cordless phone for once."</p><p>Her father seemed to have some simple psychic ability, a talent that did not amuse June at the moment. "Dad, if you see George before I do, tell him I want him to <i>suffer </i>before he dies!"</p><p>"You really need a dog, June. Haven't I been saying so? You want me to come over?"</p><p>"What for? I can handle this now."</p><p>"Okay then. Is tonight meat loaf night?"</p><p>"If I survive the day," she answered, and hung up without saying goodbye. Elmer was going to get a kick out of this a lot longer than she would.</p><p>June made sure her towel was secure, then slowly stood and looked at the family. Dad wore a suit jacket that was probably thirty years old, and Mom wore a hat. They'd put on their Sunday best for a trip to the doctor, but it seemed like they'd had a hard journey. If the man hadn't said his boy needed a doctor, June would have thought the woman was in some need; the scar that marred her face ran deep from her forehead to her chin, across a blind eye that drooped sadly. It looked as if she'd taken an ax in the head. It gave June a headache just to look at it, though obviously the wound was years old. A childhood accident, perhaps.</p><p>The boy must be in bad shape for them to come to her house. She saw he wore one boot and one clean sock. This did not bode well.</p><p>"Let me get dressed, then I'll look at your son. Stay right there, please."</p><p>So much for the peace and tranquility of country life.</p><p>Elmer used to see patients in their home. The office space wasn't an add-on suite or anything like that, just two rooms right in the middle of the house, built that way by the first town doctor. And when a patient had come to the house wearing only one shoe, it had meant the other foot was too swollen. June's training for spotting such things had begun in her childhood.</p><p>Her visitors were the Mulls; a family of very few words. June managed to learn the boy had been stepped on by a jenny&#x2014;a female donkey. The flesh was torn and rotting, and there were an unknown number of broken phalanges and metatarsals. Country people usually did much better than this with their bone settings and poultices. Maybe the boy had some metabolic problem that affected his healing. She would see that he was checked for diabetes.</p><p>"You waited too long on this injury," June told the family, comprised of Clarence Mull, his wife, Jurea, and their children, Clinton, sixteen, and Wanda, thirteen. Clinton was a strapping, handsome youth. In Wanda June could see a beauty that might have been the mother's had she not been so tragically marred. Clarence and Jurea were not young parents; June thought they might be in their fifties. "You have broken bones in the foot, and tissue and muscle damage from walking on it. Not to mention the necrotic flesh around this gash. Didn't it hurt?"</p><p>The boy shrugged. "Yeah, it was pretty bad. But Ma&#x2014;"</p><p>"It's my fault," Jurea said. "I was the one set it. And put on a poultice."</p><p>"And I bet you gave him some serious herbal remedies for the pain&#x2014;his pupils are dilated. You should go easy on that stuff."</p><p>"Works good on the pain though, don't it?" she answered.</p><p>"Too good. It was possible for him to walk on a broken foot and maybe do worse damage. Did you get to my house in a truck or car?"</p><p>"Pickup," said Clarence.</p><p>"You think it could make it as far as either Ukiah or Eureka?"</p><p>He shrugged. "We're slow but steady."</p><p>June gently pulled the sock back over the blackened, swollen foot. "How slow?" she asked.</p><p>The boy answered. "Can't get her up over thirty these days."</p><p>"Well, I have a better idea," June said. "Let me get one of the deputies to give you a lift up to Rockport, to Valley Hospital. You need to see a specialist."</p><p>"I'll get him where he needs to go," Clarence said.</p><p>"We're in a hurry now," she emphasized, going for the phone. "You already knew that or you wouldn't have brought him here at six in the morning."</p><p>"You worried that foot is going dead?" he asked.</p><p>June glanced back at him. A backwoods mountain man who could interpret necrotic tissue into a dead, gangrenous foot? Maybe he was only expressing his own fears. Still...</p><p>"I'm telling you, if you don't get that boy to the hospital, he could lose his foot. Or worse. You wouldn't want that."</p><p>"Specialis...</p></p><h2>Fair and Tender Ladies</h2><p>A series of letters, written to family and friends, reveals the life and times of Ivy Rowe, as she grows from girlhood to old age, finds love, dreams great visions, and raises a family, in an evocative portrait of Appalchia</p><p>I sell books for Ballantine.

We have always looked for methods that are safe, effective, and as rapid as possible. Never before have we seen or experienced a more powerful method that fits the above criteria than the thought energy therapy we describe in this book. In our clinical practice we have seen a 95% success rate with these methods.</p><p>We have written this book to share with as many people possible this exciting and, in many ways revolutionary new approach to emotional control. This does not mean an end to conventional therapies, however, it has the ability to eliminate unproductive emotional distress which can help people manage their lives more effectively. We want to share this knowledge and the method with as many people as are interested and open to a new way of dealing with emotions. We believe that this technique can be a sort of 'emotional first aid' and much more for everyone. We call this technique Emotional Self-Management and have taken our clinical experience and put forth a procedure than anyone who can follow simple instructions with photographs and illustrations can use and benefit from. In addition to a method to release unproductive emotional distress the method provides a way to install positive thoughts and confidence. </p><p>This method uses healing knowledge that is several thousand years old (on which acupuncture is based) and modern understanding of the role of thoughts on our emotions and that emotions are located in the mind AND the body. The procedure works by tapping specific locations on your body (while thinking about the target problem) to release the trapped emotional energy. Anyone can learn it in a short time, people from infants to adults can benefit, it is totally portable, works virtually instantly, and there are no unpleasant side effects. </p><p>We are very excited to be able to make this tool available and accessable for everyone to use for themselves to be in control of the day-to-day emotional stresses of life. We welcome feedback and readers or potential readers are invited to visit the website for the book.</p><p>Peter Lambrou, Ph.D. and George Pratt, Ph.D.</p><b>Two leading clinical psychologists offer a revolutionary new method for ridding yourself of emotional hang-ups--forever!</b><br><br>Does your fear of flying make travel with friends and family impossible?

Reprint.</p><p><i>"In October, near the end of the month, Cacciato left the war."</i><p> In Tim O'Brien's novel <i>Going After Cacciato</i> the theater of war becomes the theater of the absurd as a private deserts his post in Vietnam, intent on walking 8,000 miles to Paris for the peace talks. The remaining members of his squad are sent after him, but what happens then is anybody's guess: "The facts were simple: They went after Cacciato, they chased him into the mountains, they tried hard. They cornered him on a small grassy hill. They surrounded the hill. They waited through the night. And at dawn they shot the sky full of flares and then they moved in.... That was the end of it. The last known fact. What remained were possibilities." </p><p> It is these possibilities that make O'Brien's National Book Award-winning novel so extraordinary. Told from the perspective of squad member Paul Berlin, the search for Cacciato soon enters the realm of the surreal as the men find themselves following an elusive trail of chocolate M&amp;M's through the jungles of Indochina, across India, Iran, Greece, and Yugoslavia to the streets of Paris. The details of this hallucinatory journey alternate with feverish memories of the war--men maimed by landmines, killed in tunnels, engaged in casual acts of brutality that would be unthinkable anywhere else. Reminiscent of Joseph Heller's <i>Catch-22</i>, <i>Going After Cacciato</i> dishes up a brilliant mix of ferocious comedy and bleak horror that serves to illuminate both the complex psychology of men in battle and the overarching insanity of war. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"To call <i>Going After Cacciato</i> a novel about war is like calling <i>Moby Dick</i> a novel about whales." So wrote <i>The New York Times</i> of Tim O'Brein's now classic novel of Vietnam. Winner of the 1979 National Book Award, <i>Going After Cacciato</i> captures the peculiar blend of horror and hallucinatory comedy that marked this the strangest of wars. Reality and fantasy merge in this fictional account of one private's sudden discussion to lay down his rifle and begin a quixotic journey from the of Indochina to the streets of Paris. Will Cacciato make it all the way? Or will he be yet another casualty of a conflict that seems to have no end? In its memorable evocation of men both fleeing and meeting the demands of the battle, <i>Going After Cacciato</i> stands as much more than just a great war novel. Ultimately it's about the forces of fear and heroism that do battle in the hearts of us all. <p>"Simply put, the best novel written about the war. I do not know any writer, journalist, or novelist who does not concede that position to O'Brein's <i>Going After Cacciato</i> " -- <i>The Miami Herald</i>. </p><p>"Stark... rhapsodic... brilliant... it is a canvas painted vividly, hauntingly, disturbingly by Tim O'Brien." -- <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p></p><h2>The Short Way to Lower Scoring</h2><p>Demonstrates how to develop and maintain techniques and strategies for reducing the margin for error associated with pitch shots, chip shots, sand shots, and putts, thereby saving as many as ten strokes</p><p></p><h2>Into the Woods</h2><p>A book made &#34;after the fact&#34; from the greatly popular 1987 Broadway musical of the same name, which weaves characters from several classic fairy tales into a parable about the joys and sorrows of adulthood.</p><p>Stephen Sondheim&#39;s Tony-Award winning musical includes: Agony * It Takes Two * Stay with Me * Any Moment * No More * No One Is Alone.<b>Stephen Sondheim's</b> musical compositions and lyrics have earned him a Pulitzer Prize, an Academy Award, and numerous Tonys among other awards and honors.

I drank some fluid -- a carbohydrate drink I keep in my water bottle -- and sucked a cough drop. At that altitude, it's essential to keep your throat lubricated. </b></p> <p><b> I looked out over this vast expanse. To the south and west, I could see into Nepal, with jagged peaks ranging toward the horizon. In front of me on the north stretched the great Tibetan plateau, brown and corrugated as it dwindled into the distance. The wind was picking up, and small clouds were forming below, on the lee side of some of the smaller peaks. </b></p> <p><b> All of a sudden, a strong feeling came over me that something was going to happen. Something good. I usually feel content when the climb I'm on is going well, but this was different. I felt positive, happy. I was in a good place. </b></p> <p><b> It was 11:45 A.M. on May 1. We were just below 27,000 feet on the north face of Mount Everest. The other four guys were fanned out above me and to the east. They were in sight, but too far away to holler to. We had to use our radios to communicate. </b></p> <p><b> I attached my crampons to my pack, stood up, put the pack on, and started hiking up a small corner. Then, to my left, out of the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of a piece of blue and yellow fabric flapping in the wind, tucked behind a boulder. I thought, I'd better go look at this. Anything that wasn't part of the natural landscape was worth looking at. </b></p> <p><b> When I got to the site, I could see that the fabric was probably a piece of tent that had been ripped loose by the wind and blown down here, where it came to rest in the hollow behind the boulder. It was modern stuff, nylon. I wasn't surprised -- there are a lot of abandoned tents on Everest, and the wind just shreds them. </b></p> <p><b> But as I stood there, I carefully scanned the mountain right and left. I was wearing my prescription dark glasses, so I could see really well. As I scanned right, I saw a patch of white, about a hundred feet away. I knew at once there was something unusual about it, because of the color. It wasn't the gleaming white of snow reflecting the sun. It wasn't the white of the chunks of quartzite and calcite that crop up here and there on the north side of Everest. It had a kind of matte look -- a light-absorbing quality, like marble. </b></p> <p><b> I walked closer. I immediately saw a bare foot, sticking into the air, heel up, toes pointed downward. At that moment, I knew I had found a human body. </b></p> <p><b> Then, when I got even closer, I could see from the tattered clothing that this wasn't the body of a modern climber. This was somebody very old. </b></p> <p><b> It didn't really sink in at first. It was as if everything was in slow motion. <i>Is this a dream?</i> I wondered. <i>Am I really here?</i> But I also thought, <i>This is what we came here to do. This is who we're looking for. This is Sandy Irvine.</i> </b></p> <p><b><br> We'd agreed beforehand on a series of coded messages for the search. Everybody on the mountain could listen in on our radio conversations. If we found something, we didn't want some other expedition breaking the news to the world. </b></p> <p><b> "Boulder" was the code word for "body." So I sat down on my pack, got out my radio, and broadcast a message: "Last time I went bouldering in my hobnails, I fell off." It was the first thing that came to mind. I just threw in "hobnails," because an old hobnailed boot -- the kind that went out of style way back in the 1940s -- was still laced onto the man's right foot. That was another reason I knew he was very old. </b></p> <p><b> We all had our radios stuffed inside our down suits, so it wasn't easy to hear them. Of the other four guys out searching, only Jake Norton caught any part of my message, and all he heard was "hobnails." I could see him, some fifty yards above me and a ways to the east. Jake sat down, ripped out his radio, and broadcast back, "What was that, Conrad?" </b></p> <p><b> "Come on down," I answered. He was looking at me now, so I started waving the ski stick I always carry at altitude. "Let's get together for Snickers and tea." </b></p> <p><b> Jake knew I'd found something important, but the other three were still oblivious. He tried to wave and yell and get their attention, but it wasn't working. At 27,000 feet, because of oxygen deprivation, you retreat into a kind of personal shell; the rest of the world doesn't seem quite real. So I got back on the radio and put some urgency into my third message: "I'm calling a mandatory group meeting right now!" </b></p> <p><b> Where we were searching was fairly tricky terrain, downsloping shale slabs, some of them covered with a dusting of snow. If you fell in the wrong place, you'd go all the way, 7,000 feet to the Rongbuk Glacier. So it took the other guys a little while to work their way down and over to me. </b></p> <p><b> I rooted through my pack to get out my camera. That morning, at Camp V, I thought I'd stuck it in my pack, but I had two nearly identical stuff sacks, and it turns out I'd grabbed my radio batteries instead. I realized I'd forgotten my camera. I thought, Oh, well, if I had had the camera, I might not have found the body. That's just the way things work. </b></p> <p><b> When I told a friend about this, he asked if I'd read Faulkner's novella <i>The Bear.</i> I hadn't. On reading that story, I saw the analogy. The best hunters in the deep Mississippi woods can't even catch a glimpse of Old Ben, the huge, half-mythic bear that has ravaged their livestock for years. It's only when Ike McCaslin gives up everything he's relied on -- lays down not only his rifle, but his compass and watch -- that, lost in the forest, he's graced with the sudden presence of Old Ben in a clearing: "It did not emerge, appear: it was just there, immobile, fixed in the green and windless noon's hot dappling." </b></p> <p><b> As I sat on my pack waiting for the others, a feeling of awe and respect for the dead man sprawled in front of me started to fill me. He lay face down, head uphill, frozen into the slope. A tuft of hair stuck out from the leather pilot's cap he had on his head. His arms were raised, and his fingers were planted in the scree, as if he'd tried to self-arrest with them. It seemed likely that he was still alive when he had come to rest in this position. There were no gloves on his hands; later I'd think long and hard about the implications of that fact. I took off my own gloves to compare my hands to his. I've got short, thick fingers; his were long and thin, and deeply tanned, probably from the weeks of having walked the track all the way from Darjeeling over the crest of the Himalaya to the north face of Everest. </b></p> <p><b> The winds of the decades had torn most of the clothing away from his back and lower torso. He was naturally mummified -- that patch of alabaster I'd spotted from a hundred feet away was the bare, perfectly preserved skin of his back. What was incredible was that I could still see the powerful, well-defined muscles in his shoulders and back, and the blue discoloration of bruises. </b></p> <p><b> Around his shoulders and upper arms, the remnants of seven or eight layers of clothing still covered him -- shirts and sweaters and jackets made of wool, cotton, and silk. There was a white, braided cotton rope tied to his waist, about three eighths of an inch in diameter -- many times weaker than any rope we'd use today. The rope was tangled around his left shoulder. About ten feet from his waist, I could see the frayed end where the rope had broken. So I knew at once that he'd been tied to his partner, and that he'd taken a long fall. The rope had either broken in the fall, or when his partner tried to belay him over a rock edge. </b></p> <p><b> The right elbow looked as if it was dislocated or broken. It lay imbedded in the scree, bent in an unnatural position. The right scapula was a little disfigured. And above his waist on a right rib, I could see the blue contusion from an upward pull of the rope as it took the shock of the fall. </b></p> <p><b> His right leg was badly broken, both tibia and fibula. With the boot still on, the leg lay at a grotesque angle. They weren't compound fractures -- the bones hadn't broken the skin -- but they were very bad breaks. My conclusion was that in the fall, the right side of the man's body had taken the worst of the impact. It looked as though perhaps in his last moments, the man had laid his good left leg over his broken right, as if to protect it from further harm. The left boot may have been whipped off in the fall, or it may have eroded and fallen apart. Only the tongue of the boot was present, pinched between the bare toes of his left foot and the heel of his right boot. </b></p> <p><b> Goraks -- the big black ravens that haunt the high Himalaya -- had pecked away at the right buttock and gouged out a pretty extensive hole, big enough for a gorak to enter. From that orifice, they had eaten out most of the internal organs, simply hollowed out the body. </b></p> <p><b> The muscles of the left lower leg and the thighs had become stringy and desiccated. It's what happens, apparently, to muscles exposed for seventy-five years. The skin had split and opened up, but for some reason the goraks hadn't eaten it. </b></p> <p><b> After fifteen or twenty minutes, Jake Norton arrived. Then the others, one by one: first Tap Richards, then Andy Politz, then Dave Hahn. They didn't say much: just, "Wow, good job, Conrad," or, "This has to be Sandy Irvine." Later Dave said, "I started blinking in awe," and Tap remembered, "I was pretty blown away. It was obviously a body, but it looked like a Greek or Roman marble statue." </b></p> <p><b> The guys took photos, shot some video, and discussed the nuances of the scene. There seemed to be a kind of taboo about touching him. Probably half an hour passed before we got up the nerve to touch him. But we had agreed that if we found Mallory or Irvine, we would perform as professional an excavation as we could under the circumstances, to see if what we found might cast any light on the mystery of their fate. We had even received permission from John Mallory (George's son) to take a small DNA sample. </b></p> <p><b> Tap and Jake did most of the excavating work. We'd planned to cut small squares out of the clothing to take down to Base Camp and analyze. Almost at once, on the collar of one of the shirts, Jake found a name tag. It read, "G. Mallory." Jake looked at us and said, "That's weird. Why would Irvine be wearing Mallory's shirt?" </b></p> <p><b><br> </b></p> <p><b> Sometime on the morning of June 8, 1924, George Mallory and Sandy Irvine set out from Camp VI, at 26,800 feet on the northeast ridge. The day before, the porters who had carried gear and food up to the camp in support of the summit bid brought down a note from Mallory, addressed to the expedition cinematographer, John Noel, who was ensconced at Camp III, more than 5,000 feet below. </b></p> <p><b><br> Dear Noel,<br> We'll probably start early to-morrow (8th) in order to have clear weather. It won't be too early to start looking for us either crossing the rock band under the pyramid or going up skyline at 8.0 P.M.<br> Yours ever,<br> G. Mallory </b></p> <p><b><br> Noel had a 600 millimeter lens that the expedition members used like a telescope to track their teammates' movements high on Everest. All subsequent commentators have assumed, as Odell did on reading the note, that Mallory's "8.0 P.M." was a slip of the pen, that he meant to write "8:00 A.M." In that case, Mallory's estimate of where he would be was exceedingly optimistic, for it was rare in the era of early Himalayan campaigns for a pair of climbers to get off from any high camp before 6:30 in the morning. </b></p> <p><b> The 1924 expedition was the third of three attempts -- all British -- on the world's highest mountain; it followed a thoroughgoing reconnaissance in 1921 and a nervy assault the year after. Only Mallory had been a member of all three expeditions. Yet the weather in May 1924 had proved atrocious, defeating a very strong team's best efforts even to put themselves in position for a summit thrust. Later the tea planters in Darjeeling would aver that for at least the previous twenty years, "no such weather had been known at this season." </b></p> <p><b> Then, with the climbers' hopes all but extinguished, the mountain had laid a spell of grace upon them, giving them day after day of fine weather, although the men woke each morning dreading the onset of the inevitable monsoon, which, normally arriving around June 1, would enfold the Himalaya in a four-month miasma of heavy snow. </b></p> <p><b> As Mallory and Irvine closed their canvas tent and headed along the windswept ridge, they were full of a bursting anticipation. Only four days before, their teammate E. F. "Teddy" Norton, at the end of a gallant effort, had reached 28,126 feet -- the highest anyone had ever climbed -- before turning back a mere 900 feet below the summit. Norton had made his gutsy push without the aid of bottled oxygen. Mallory and Irvine were breathing gas, and though Mallory had initially been a skeptic about its efficacy, on the 1922 expedition he had learned firsthand that climbers aided by oxygen high on Everest could easily double the climbing speed of those without. </b></p> <p><b> On the 1924 assault, as he had during the two previous expeditions, Mallory had proven himself the strongest and most ambitious climber. By now, his personal obsession with Everest had cranked as tight as it could be wound. In a letter to his wife, Ruth, written six weeks before from Chiblung, on the approach to Everest, he had predicted, "It is almost unthinkable...that I shan't get to the top; I can't see myself coming down defeated." </b></p> <p><b> If his twenty-two-year-old companion was daunted by Mallory's hubris, he gave no indication of it. In his diary only four days before his own attempt, awaiting the outcome of Teddy Norton's bold summit bid with teammate Howard Somervell, Irvine had written, "I hope they've got to the top, but by God, I'd like to have a whack at it myself." </b></p> <p><b> Ever since 1924, observers have wondered why Mallory chose Irvine as his partner for the second summit attempt, rather than the far more experienced Noel Odell, who had rounded into incomparable form at high altitude during the preceding week. Irvine had very little climbing experience, with only an exploratory outing in Spitsbergen under his belt. (In a letter to Ruth, Mallory had voiced a qualm, "I wish Irvine had had a season in the Alps.") But on Everest, the Oxford undergraduate had proved to be tougher than several of his more seasoned comrades, an uncomplaining worker, and a delightful companion. He was also something of a mechanical genius, who had taken apart the oxygen apparatus in the field and rebuilt it in a lighter and more efficient form. And since oxygen would be the key to Mallory's all-out dash for the summit, it made sense to have Irvine along. </b></p> <p><b> That day, June 8, 1924, among the rest of the team, only Odell, climbing solo up to Camp VI in support of the summit duo, was high on the mountain. A professional geologist, he had chosen the day to wander in zigzags up the north face, looking for unusual formations. By late morning, he was swimming in a private ecstasy, for there, in one of the most barren places on earth, he had discovered the first fossils ever f...</b></p></p><h2>Dressing for Glamour</h2><p>Bob Mackie, four-time Emmy Award winner and the man who makes the TV and film stars shine, now gives you his secrets on how to Dress for Glamour.

He was on the street under my bedroom window. I was on my knees looking out. The sound, it had woke me. The window was open for air, which there was not much of, and what there was did not move. The curtain did not blow aside, and it was dark in my room, and I knew they could not see me.<br><br>The man who was going to die was on his knees. Like myself. Only with his arms out. Not up, like a stickup. Straight out, like Christ on his cross, only with his knees bent. I call him a man because I was only seven at the time. To me he looked big. Now I can remember his face, both before and after, and I know he was maybe sixteen. But I mistook him for a man.<br><br>The guys doing the killing, there were three, standing up. Laughing, which is what woke me I think. One of them had a sawed-off shotgun right in the man's face. Sort of a man. I guess if you are about to die like that, you're more than a boy.<br><br>Now the sort-of-man, he started to cry. Big crocodile tears. Or what they call that, anyway. Why they call them crocodile tears I don't know. I have never seen a crocodile cry. I have never seen a crocodile. But I watched a man die. So I know some things. Only maybe they are not the best things to know.<br><br>Then the almost-dead man, he started up begging. Please, he said. Please, think of my mama. Think of the kids I ain't even get to have yet. Please don't do this, I'll do anything, what do you want me to do? His shoulders shook, like a little earthquake right under the street that nobody could feel but him. His own little personal seven point one, just under his knees.<br><br>Please, he said, and the one with the sawed-off shotgun shot him in the face. Then the three, they walked off laughing. Turned the corner, laughing. I had to keep watching, because I was afraid to not watch. I was afraid to go back to bed. Because the dead sort-of-man, he would still be there. He had to be where I could see. I remember real good what he looked like after, but it's something I do not plan to say a whole lot about. Because some things, they are plain ugly. This thing, I figure it's bad enough<i> I</i> know.<br><br>After a while the cops came, and I got tired, and they were there to look and know where he was, so I went back to bed.<br><br>There is no mercy. Give up on that. Don't ask.<br><br>I decided when my number came up someday, I would not beg. I would take my dignity with me. They say you can't take it with you, but mostly about money and cars and such. Dignity, I think you can. And I think you will miss it sorely if you leave it behind. Anyway, we all believe what we want and that's what I believe.<br>Speaking of dignity, it is dignity when you own what you did. Not pretend. So, I shot that man. Just like they think I did. I will say that now. I shot that man between the eyes, in Rosalita's kitchen, where he stood with no pants on. Killed him with his own gun. It was my birthday that day. I was thirteen.<br><br>I knew he was a cop, but what difference is that supposed to make? Even if I could have known somehow I would die for it later. It's always better to die later. A time like that, you have to make a fast choice, and it's never die/not die. It's always die now/die later. Rosalita taught me that. She said, "Girl, comes clear somebody's number 'bout to be up, try and see it ain't you. Let him die now, you die some other time. When your number finally come up, you'll be ready. You'll've had lotsa practice." That made sense to me. But I don't think that's why I shot him.<br><br>I did not laugh or have fun.<br><br>I guess I felt some bad for it later, but at the time I don't know what I felt. Not the half of what I should've, that I can say for a fact. I was not a cold person. Just alive, like everybody else, and trying to stay that way awhile longer.<br><br>I guess I felt bad later because I could've let go of the gun. Not pulled on it. I think if I'd just let him take it back he might not've hurt me or anything. But then you don't know for a fact and you just do something and then it's the wrong something. I worry sometimes, did I shoot him because he didn't love me and never would? But I really think it wasn't on purpose. Only, sometimes I see people fool themselves, so I ask myself all the same. But I don't think I meant for it to happen. Besides, if I was to kill everybody who didn't love me and never would, wouldn't be nobody left on the planet but maybe Rosalita and Leonard, my little boy. Who, of course, was not even borned at the time.<br><br>This is how it was.<br><br>On account of it was my birthday, I had been almost all day looking for Mama. What one of these things has to do with the other I can't say that I know. What I thought she would do about it being my birthday, well, she wouldn't do nothing. That much is real clear now. But it made me look for her all the same.<br><br>To make things worse, Rosalita had got arrested, only this time she did not come back. And I had to wonder why. Usually it wouldn't take her no more than two, three hours to make it home. Cop would pick her up, take her on a ride supposed to be to the station. Only they'd go someplace else, she doing for him for free what he was supposed to be taking her in for. Then he'd drop her back on the corner.<br><br>This time she did not come home all day. Maybe some cop really put her in jail. Maybe he didn't want nothing from her, or had kids and a wife he wanted to stay true to for real. Or a bag of other maybes I could not understand. What had happened to things? I didn't know.<br><br>I went by to where Little Julius was sitting out on his stoop and I asked him did he see my mama.<br><br>"Maybe I seen her," he said. "Maybe I ain't. Why'nt you come over a little closer here and we talk about it?"<br><br>I didn't get no closer to Little Julius. He was a big fat man with his hair shaved all off and little designs shaved in, and when he smiled, his front teeth were all gold. You would think it would look nice--all that gold. But no. It was ugly in a way I could never explain. He liked the color of my skin because of me being part black and part Korean. He said I am fine. Not that day, but he had said it. In the past. And even that day, even with him not saying it, you could feel that hanging around.<br><br>I said, "Maybe did you sell her something?"<br><br>Little Julius said, "Ain't got nothin' to sell. Ain't got no product. If you would listen to reason maybe I would have. You and me, we could do okay. Little girl like you, just don't have no idea what you got. You and your mama, live in a real house. You'd be doin' okay."<br><br>I knew we were talking two very different kinds of things and so did he. I cared and Little Julius, he did not.<br><br>"Who she buy from when she don't buy from you?"<br><br>Little Julius frowned. Frown like that means maybe time to back up. Maybe time to get the hell somewhere else.<br><br>I say no to guys all the time. Every day. Most don't like it any too much. Sometime I say yes. The good ones, they're not sure what they feel. Feel too many things at once. They are the only kind I say yes to. The too-sure kind, I say no. They got no conscience to make them feel some other things. Watch out for that.<br>I waited under the freeway overpass for some guy they called Slacker. Listening to the cars go over my head--thump-thump, thump-thump--I was wondering what makes that thump sound. If there are bumps in the road or something. But I never been on that road, or most others. Me and Mama didn't have a car. I was wondering should I go back in and ask for this Slacker guy again. But I was in that bar once already, and the bartender man, he threw me out. Said I would lose him his license. Said he would send this Slacker out to see me.<br><br>Thump-thump. How long it would take him to come out and see me I didn't know.<br><br>I was thinking maybe I would just go on back to Rosalita's. Give this up for the day. But it's a long walk back there. If I had bus fare maybe I would've already been gone. The day was already almost over.<br><br>Then this man came walking by. Looked too good to be down there. You know, with a suit and all. A white man with a shiny gold wedding ring. I was sitting on the sidewalk and he looked down at me and I looked up at him, and I knew he had the taste. I could see it in his eyes. And I knew he would give me some money if I asked, because he did not know it. At least, he did not know it out loud. So he would think he was looking at me for some much nicer reasons. Like I am this nice young person he wants to help out, and like there is no shame in a thing like that. I looked up into his eyes like I had fallen into something I couldn't quite find my way out of. Which in some ways was the truth.<br><br>"You okay?" he said.<br><br>"Can't get home," I said. "No bus fare."<br><br>He took out his wallet and pulled out three one-dollar bills. I could tell he did not ever ride the bus and was trying to think what that might cost. I didn't tell him, because then he would give me the most he thought it might be. He reached it down to me and I wondered what he would do if my hand touched his when I took it. I knew he was a man who would feel lots of things at once. I could say yes to a man like that. Maybe get a steak dinner for my birthday. But then he let go real quick and walked on. I watched his back walking away. That is a man who knows trouble when he scrapes by it. That's what I told myself while I watched him walk away.<br><br>Then next thing I knew this white dude with his hair slicked back came out of the bar and said maybe he is Slacker and maybe not. All depends on who is asking. I said I am asking and then he figured maybe yeah, that's who he is.<br><br>I asked him did he see my mama. And I told him about the scar she wore on her face, so that way he would know which mama she is.<br><br>He said yeah, maybe he might've made a sale to a person such as that, and maybe by now she would've gone on home to use up what she got. Like that a...</p><h2>The Janus Stone</h2><p>Ruth Galloway&#39;s expertise is called upon when builders, demolishing an old house in Norwich, uncover the bones of a child - minus the skull - beneath a doorway.

First came the discography <i>Put Your Dreams Away</i>; then, the newsy expos� of the Chairman's FBI dossier, <i>The Sinatra Files</i>; and now, his life story as seen by his younger daughter Tina. Besides inside family stuff, Tina knows about Frank's life from having produced the CBS miniseries about him. The most publicized item in the book concerns Frank's kind words with the Mafia on behalf of JFK's campaign. But, beware the common belief that the Mafia stole the election for JFK--this is dubious--and don't miss out on all of the more interesting stories in the book. There's irony: JFK personally persuaded United Artists to make Sinatra's best film, that classic of Presidential-assassination conspiracy, <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>. There's squalor: Before the Mafia helped him through his career slump, Frank walked past an Eddie Fisher movie marquee and promptly attempted suicide. There's poignance: "I'm not home much, but I'm a pretty damned good father," Frank unconvincingly claimed. Nancy Barbato Sinatra--the mother of Tina, Nancy, and Frank Jr.--comes off as saintly. Ava Gardner was nice to the kids, but a comparably neurotic brawler with Frank. Mia Farrow, Tina's schoolmate, was delightful, inclined to intense relationships with father figures (Salvador Dal�, Yul Brynner), eccentric, and not as frail and malleable as she looked and Frank probably hoped: "She was just as career-driven as Ava, and probably more independent," writes Tina. "Mia was more of a day person, while the only dawns my father saw were on the back end of a hard day's night." Barbara Marx Sinatra, according to embittered Tina, made Frank's last 12 years a living hell. (Barbara has declined to comment on Tina's charges.) <p> In straightforward prose that's studded with interesting facts (did you know Frank would tip $200 if you parked his car?) and 86 photos, Tina Sinatra paints a lively portrait of her inconsolably lonely pop-star pop. And she did it her way. Deal with it. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>Tina Sinatra</b> was the executive producer of <i>Sinatra,</i> an award-winning five-hour miniseries based on her father's life that aired in 1992 on CBS.

By 1500 they were printed and numbered in their millions. Printing made possible the development of modern science and literature, and the political shift from statelets to nations. It brought about the biggest changes in human culture since the invention of the alphabet itself. The man responsible was Johann Gutenberg, born in 1400 in Mainz, Germany. John Man explains how this technical genius whose research into printing was funded by wealthy sponsors, struggled against a background of plague, religious upheaval and legal battles to bring his remarkable invention to light.</p><p>John Man is a historian and writer with a special interest in Mongolia. As well as writing several books, he devised and presented the BBC Radio 4 series, Survivors.`John Man recounts lucidly, filling in the social, religious and political background... his book pitches itself unashamedly at the general reader.... an intelligent narrative marked by engaging enthusiasm and quite a few eloquent passages&#39; * Financial Times * This is a very good introduction to Gutenberg and his world * New Statesman * `storytelling drive...

More than an engaging guide to the subtle intricacies of the sport, Walton&#39;s reflective treatise is a graceful portrait of rural England that extols the pleasures of country life.</p><p>For a book to stay in print for nearly 350 years, its merits must continually entice and allure. <i>The Compleat Angler</i> satisfies that on two counts. On the most obvious level, it remains as good a primer on fishing as any angler would want. But its most enduring distinction--what's raised an essential sporting how-to to the level of literary classic--is the one cast off by its subtitle; Izaak Walton's sometimes convoluted 17th-century grammar can still reel in our imaginations with his graceful evocations of a life free from hurly-burly in the company of friends intent on physical and moral sustenance. "He that hopes to be a good Angler must not only bring an inquiring, searching, observing wit," suggests the master, "but he must bring a large measure of hope and patience.... Doubt not but Angling will prove to be so pleasant, that it will prove to be like a virtue, a reward to itself." Just like Walton's magnificent literary catch.This edition includes Charles Cotton&#39;s additional material, requested by Izaak Walton for the book&#39;s fifth edition.</p><h2>The Watchman: A Joe Pike Novel</h2><p>Working as a bodyguard for a spoiled federal witness, Joe Pike hatches a desperate plan to disappear with the woman in the underworld of Los Angeles and turn on her would-be killers, an effort in which he enlists the help of private investigator Elvis Cole.</p><p><b>Robert Crais</b> is the author of many novels, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Last Detective</i>, <i>Hostage</i>, and <i>L.A.

His character, manner, and ethic resemble that of Harry Callahan (Dirty Harry), and thanks to James Daniels, so does his voice. When Daniels isn't portraying Pike, his glib delivery moves the action along. And there's plenty of that when Pike is hired to protect a rich 22-year-old from L.A. Seems that she's seen something--or someone--she shouldn't have. Fifteen minutes into this thriller, Pike has blown away five villains, with more to come. In between, Crais's stories of Pike's past lives--as Marine, cop, and mercenary--make Dirty Harry pale in comparison. It appears that Crais has another winning character.

Kennedy</h2><p><p> <i>Neither a random event nor the act of a lone madman&#x2014;the assassination of President John F. Kennedy was an appalling and grisly conspiracy. This is the unvarnished story.</i> </p><p> With deft investigative skill, David Kaiser shows that the events of November 22, 1963, cannot be understood without fully grasping the two larger stories of which they were a part: the U.S. government&#x2019;s campaign against organized crime, which began in the late 1950s and accelerated dramatically under Robert Kennedy; and the furtive quest of two administrations&#x2014;along with a cadre of private interest groups&#x2014;to eliminate Fidel Castro. </p><p> The seeds of conspiracy go back to the Eisenhower administration, which recruited top mobsters in a series of plots to assassinate the Cuban leader. The CIA created a secretive environment in which illicit networks were allowed to expand in dangerous directions. The agency&#x2019;s links with the Mafia continued in the Kennedy administration, although the President and his closest advisors&#x2014;engaged in their own efforts to overthrow Castro&#x2014;thought this skullduggery had ended. Meanwhile, Cuban exiles, right-wing businessmen, and hard-line anti-Communists established ties with virtually anyone deemed capable of taking out the Cuban premier. Inevitably those ties included the mob. </p><p> The conspiracy to kill JFK took shape in response to Robert Kennedy&#x2019;s relentless attacks on organized crime&#x2014;legal vendettas that often went well beyond the normal practices of law enforcement. Pushed to the wall, mob leaders merely had to look to the networks already in place for a solution. They found it in Lee Harvey Oswald&#x2014;the ideal character to enact their desperate revenge against the Kennedys. </p><p> Comprehensive, detailed, and informed by original sources, <i>The Road to Dallas</i> adds surprising new material to every aspect of the case. It brings to light the complete, frequently shocking, story of the JFK assassination and its aftermath. </p></p><p><b>David Kaiser</b> is a noted historian and a professor in the Strategy and Policy Department of the Naval War College.While plenty of authors have argued that the Mafia and anti-Castro Cubans were behind the assassination of President Kennedy, few have done so as convincingly as Naval War College history professor Kaiser...His attention to detail and use of recently released FBI and CIA files put this analysis ahead of many of its fellows...This is a deeply disturbing look at a national tragedy, and Kaiser's sober tone and reasoned analysis may well convince some in the Oswald-was-a-lone-nut camp. (<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i> 2007-11-26)<br><br>In the seemingly neverending arms race between the lone-assassin and the conspiracy theorists, Kaiser adds a serious piece of scholarship to the arsenal of those who believe Americans have yet to learn the whole truth about the assassination of JFK. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2008-01-01)<br><br>A scrupulously researched account, which may be one of the best books yet on the assassination...Kaiser posits that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman although he did not act alone: the murder plot was hatched by Mafia bosses Santo Trafficante, John Roselli, and Sam Giancana as revenge for Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's relentless pursuit of the mob and for the vast sums of money they lost when Castro closed Cuba's mob-controlled casinos. Other startling revelations are that Oswald might have been a CIA agent, even though he was promised a large sum of money by the mob to kill Kennedy, and that Jack Ruby killed Oswald on orders from the Mafia, to which Ruby was connected. This detailed, often chilling account stands out among the overwhelming number of assassination books. (Karl Helicher <i>Library Journal (starred review)</i> 2008-02-01)<br><br>A thorough recounting of facts interspersed with interpretations and opinions that carry the weight of someone who knows how to analyze history... Kaiser isn't the first to suggest JFK was assassinated by a conspiracy of anti-Castro Cubans upset at Kennedy's failure to eliminate Fidel Castro and a Mafia enraged by the obsession of JFK's attorney general, his brother Robert Kennedy, to attack organized crime. But Kaiser may be the first to reach the depth of reporting the facts that support this theory...It would be hard to imagine anyone but Kennedy assassination scholars and historians not learning something new in Kaiser's book. For fans of Oliver Stone's movie <i>JFK</i> (1991) and JFK assassination junkies, the book is the latest--and perhaps best--view of the historic event. (Roman Modrowski <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> 2008-03-23)<br><br>In <i>The Road to Dallas</i> we see the rare vindication of the lunatic fringe, as Kaiser--who teaches history at the Naval War College--puts forth the first serious historical study to confirm what we've long suspected: that JFK's killing was not the work of a lone madman. Comprehensive and well documented, <i>The Road to Dallas</i> connects the dots from the CIA to Carlos Marcello with convincing thoroughness. If you think you've had enough of grassy-knoll theories, this book will surprise you. (Leopold Froehlich <i>Playboy</i> 2008-04-01)<br><br>Historian David Kaiser's meticulously researched new work, <i>The Road to Dallas</i>, about the shocking and clandestine maneuverings of our CIA and FBI under President John F. Kennedy, paints a disturbing portrait of what often goes undetected at the highest levels of government...Kaiser's investigation seems to put to rest the long-held notion put forth by the Warren Report that Oswald acted alone and was simply a nutty gunman. He examines new evidence that lays out Oswald's extensive entanglements with suspicious persons prior to the assassination...Kaiser's fine book destroys any romantic view of world politics we might wish to cling to--and shows us a much darker reality. (Elaine Margolin <i>Denver Post</i> 2008-04-04)<br><br>A most interesting book on the JFK killing--much better than almost all the rest...It is 509 pages long, costs $35, and is well worth the time and money...[The] trove of official material has been sifted by some (not as many as one might expect) writers and historians in the intervening years, but by none exhibiting Kaiser&#x2018;s dogged approach, application of logic, clear writing style, understandable presentation and impressive analytical ability...This is a dynamite book--understandable, readable and as vivid as the best crime novels. Only this hit job happened. And it changed our world. (John Hanchette <i>Niagara Falls Reporter</i> 2008-07-01)<br><br>We may yet one day discover a "smoking gun" that makes all other theories fall away. Until then, Kaiser's book may rise to be the most plausible explanation we are likely to read. (Richard Delevan <i>Irish Independent</i> 2008-06-28)<br><br>Kaiser, a respected professional historian at the Naval War College, combed through mounds of previously classified documents to craft an interesting, well-written account of the days leading up to the assassination. Kaiser effectively places the events that transpired in Dallas within the context of contemporary politics. He masterfully tracks the administration's vendetta against organized crime and the numerous Kennedy-era assassination plots against Fidel Castro. The author lucidly argues that the assassination, although carried out by Lee Harvey Oswald, was the culmination of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy's crusade against the mob. While this conspiracy theory is not new, the supporting documentation and the captivating account laid out by an established historian makes for some fascinating reading. (J. B.

Contentedly, she cooed, whispered, and babbled, learning the river&#x2019;s language, and focused her gaze on the stormy dance of evening sky&#x2013;roiling purple clouds edged with blood red. The old man surmised she was waiting and listening for whoever, or whatever, had forsaken her there.<br><br>Those fevered moments of his discovery burnt into the old man&#x2019;s memory. In the years that followed, he would hold and turn them in his mind the way an explorer ponders relics he has found in the midst of ruin. But the mystery remained stubbornly opaque. No matter how often he exaggerated the story to impress his fireside listeners&#x2013;&#x201c;I dove into that ragin&#x2019; river and caught her by the toe!&#x201d; &#x201c;I fought off that hungry river wyrm with my picker-staff just in time!&#x201d;&#x2013;he found no clue to her origins, no answers to questions of why or how.<br><br>The Gatherers, House Abascar, the Expanse&#x2013;the whole world might have been different had he left her there with riverwater running from her hair. &#x201c;The River Girl&#x201d;&#x2013;that was what the Gatherers came to call her until she grew old enough to set them straight. Without the River Girl, the four houses of the Expanse might have perished in their troubles. But then again, some say that without the River Girl those troubles might never have come at all.<br><br>This is how the spark was struck.<br><br>A ruckus of crows caught Krawg&#x2019;s attention as he groped for berries deep in a bramble. He and Warney, the conspirator with whom he had been caught thieving so many years ago, were laboring to pay their societal debts to House Abascar. The day had been long, but Krawg&#x2019;s spirits were high. No officers had come to reckon their work and berate them. Not yet. Tired of straining for latesummer apples high in the boughs of ancient trees, they had put down their picker-staffs and turned to plucking sourjuice and jewelweed bushes an applecore&#x2019;s throw from the Throanscall.<br><br>Warney was preoccupied, trying to free his thorn-snagged sleeves and leggings.<br><br>So Krawg smiled, dropped his harvesting sack, and crept away to investigate the cause of the birds&#x2019; cacophony. He hoped to find them eying an injured animal, maybe a broad-antlered buck he could finish off and present to the duty officers. That would be a prize grand enough to deserve preparation in King Cal-marcus&#x2019;s kitchens. Such a discovery might bring Krawg closer to the king&#x2019;s grace and a pardon.<br><br>&#x201c;Aw, will you look at that?&#x201d; Krawg flexed his bony fingers. The feathered curmudgeons flapped at the air over the riverbank, their gaze fixed on a disturbance in the grass.<br><br>&#x201c;Now, hold on!&#x201d; called his even bonier friend. &#x201c;Whatcha got there? Wait for me!&#x201d; Twigs snapped and fabric ripped, but Warney made no progress. &#x201c;Speak up now, what&#x2019;re them flappers squawkin&#x2019; over? Are beastmen coming to kill us?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stop spookin&#x2019;, fraidy-brain,&#x201d; Krawg growled, and then he gusted air through his nostrils. &#x201c;There won&#x2019;t be no beastman savages out here in the afternoon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it then? Merchants?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No merchants.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it a swarm of stingers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br><b><br></b>&#x201c;A fangbear? River wyrms? Bramblepigs?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some young buster sneakin&#x2019; up behind us? Come on now. What&#x2019;s got them birds so bothered?&#x201d;<br><br>According to his nature, Krawg tossed back a lie. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re just fightin&#x2019; over a mess of reekin&#x2019; twister fish they snatched out of the shallows.&#x201d; Groundwater closed over his feet as he made his way through the reeds on the riverbank. Increasingly perturbed by the way Krawg was stalking their target, the crows descended to the branch of a stooping cottonbeard tree and pelted him with insults.<br><br>As Krawg combed the grasses for an answer, Warney at last emerged from the trees with worry in his one good eye, gripping as if it were a hunting spear the long, clawed picker-staff he had used all day to drag down the higher appleboughs.<br><br>Warney seemed barely more than a skeleton wrapped in loose flesh and a rough burlap cloak. &#x201c;What are they fussin&#x2019; about now if they&#x2019;ve gone and eaten their fill?&#x201d;<br><br>Krawg&#x2019;s vulturebeak nose twitched in the middle of the few undisciplined whiskers that grew where a mustache did not. He leaned forward, apprehensive, and saw not a pile of fish bones but two tiny pink hands reaching into the air.<br><br>&#x201c;One of the fish has got hands!&#x201d; gasped Warney.<br><br>&#x201c;Shush now! It isn&#x2019;t a pile of fish.&#x201d; Krawg took hold of the appleknife in his pocket. &#x201c;Whatever it is, it&#x2019;s harmless, I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br><br>Warney glanced back at the woods. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget to watch for you-knowwho. Duty officers&#x2019;ll haul us in, bottom &#x2019;n&#x2019; blockhead, if they catch us messin&#x2019; with anything other than them berries. They&#x2019;ll ride their stinkin&#x2019; lizards right through here soon. Come on now...there&#x2019;s a nice bramble just back here. You don&#x2019;t want the duty to string us up in the hangers, do ya?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good creepin&#x2019; Cragavar forest, of all the bloody wonders I ever seen...<br><br>Looky!&#x201d; The braver Gatherer flipped his black hood back from his hairless head and bent to examine the child. Warney remained where he was. &#x201c;Krawg, you&#x2019;re givin&#x2019; me the shut-mouth again. What is it, old boy?&#x201d;<br><b><br></b>&#x201c;Just a creepin&#x2019;, crawlin&#x2019; baby, it is.&#x201d; Krawg massaged the flab beneath his chin. &#x201c;Mercy, Warney, look at her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a her? How do you know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, howdaya think I know?&#x201d; Krawg reached for the child, then thought better of it. &#x201c;Warney, this must mean somethin&#x2019;. You and me...findin&#x2019; this.&#x201d;He scanned the spaces between trees on both sides of the mist-shrouded river and confirmed that the only witnesses were crows and a tailtwitcher that clung upside down to the trunk of a birch.<br><br>Warney splashed into the river shallows and prodded the submerged ground with his picker-staff before each step. The weeds around his ankles whispered <i>hushhh...hushhh...hushhh.<br><br></i>The child convulsed twice. She coughed up droplets of water. And then she made a sound that might have been a laugh.<br><br>&#x201c;Now that&#x2019;s odd.&#x201d; Krawg gestured to the child&#x2019;s tiny head. &#x201c;She got brown and silver hairs. She&#x2019;s seen at least two seasons, I&#x2019;d say. Probably born before that hard freeze we had awhile back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, gotta &#x2019;gree with ya there.&#x201d; Warney&#x2019;s eye was white as a sparrow&#x2019;s egg in the shadows of his hood.<br><br>&#x201c;And she&#x2019;s not the spawn of those beastmen. Everything about her seems like a good baby girl, not some accursed cross between person and critter. Looks like she&#x2019;s been fed and looked after too...well, until she got tossed into the river, I suppose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gotta &#x2019;gree with ya there.&#x201d;Warney now leaned over the child, swaying like a scarecrow in the wind. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s better fed than any of us Gatherers...or crows, for that matter.&#x201d;<br><br>The crows were quiet, watching, picking at their sharp toes. Krawg knelt and took to picking at his toes as well, poking at yellow places, which meant he was thinking hard. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re too far east of House Bel Amica for her to belong to them proud and greedy folk. But how could she be from our good House Abascar? Folk from Abascar only step out of the house walls if<br>King Cal-marcus tells &#x2019;em to. Too scared of beastmen, they are...these days.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gotta &#x2019;gree with ya there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you always gotta &#x2019;gree with me there?!&#x201d; Krawg snatched the pickerstaff from Warney&#x2019;s hands and clubbed his hooded head. Warney jumped away, growled, and bared his teeth. Krawg tossed the staff aside and rose up like a bear answering the challenge of a rat. Warney, like a rat realizing he has awakened a bear, fled back toward the quiet woods.<br><br>&#x201c;Now don&#x2019;t you get it in your head to leave me here with this orphan,&#x201d; Krawg called, &#x201c;or I&#x2019;ll rip that patch off your dead eye!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have ya thought...&#x201d;Warney paused, turned, and clasped his head with both hands, as if trying to stretch his mind to accommodate a significant thought. &#x201c;Has it occurred to ya that... Do ya think...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Speak, you rangy crook!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh ballyworms, Krawg! What if she&#x2019;s a Northchild?&#x201d;<br><br>Krawg stumbled back a step and narrowed his eyes at the infant. The tailtwitcher, the crows, and even the river seemed to quiet at Warney&#x2019;s question.<br><br>But Krawg at last shook off worry. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t shovel that vawn pile my way, Warney.You been eatin&#x2019; too much of Yawny&#x2019;s stew, and your dreams are gettin&#x2019; to you. Only crazies think Northchildren are actual. There&#x2019;s no such thing.&#x201d;<br><br>They watched the baby&#x2019;s hands sculpt shapes in the air. &#x201c;And anyway,&#x201d; Krawg continued, glancing northward at the sky purpling over the jagged mountains of the Forbidding Wall, &#x201c;everybody knows Northchildren are taller, and they drape blankets over themselves.&#x201d;<br><br>Nearby, branches broke with sharp echoes as something moved in the woods.<br><br>&#x201c;Grab for a weapon,&#x201d; hissed Warney, &#x201c;because I smell prowling beastmen!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doubtful,&#x201d; said Krawg, but he bent his knees and sank into the grass.<br><br>&#x201c;Duty officers then!&#x201d;<br><br>In case their overseers were, in fact, looking for them, Krawg shouted, &#x201c;We better get back to the patches, Warney! I sure don&#x2019;t see any berries out here.&#x201d;<br><br>He lifted Warney&#x2019;s picker-staff and marched to join his friend in the trees. But Warney seemed stuck, as though the girl had tossed a rope and snared his ankle. &#x201c;You know what they say.

The Gatherers watched her clap her tiny hands.<br><br>A crow took wing from the cottonbeard tree and made a wide circle over the child&#x2019;s bed.<br>&#x201c;They want that fresh meat,&#x201d; Krawg observed. Warney nodded. &#x201c;Gotta &#x2019;gree with ya...&#x201d; His mouth snapped shut, and he winced.<br><br>Krawg loosed a weary sigh, waved a scornful gesture at the birds, and returned to kneel beside the baby. Warney hopped back to peer over Krawg&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that she&#x2019;s lyin&#x2019; in? That isn&#x2019;t a sinkhole.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, somebody carved out this hole with their hands.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not with their hands, no. Look, Krawg...<i>toes. </i>This Northchild&#x2019;s lyin&#x2019; in a footprint!&#x201d; <br><br>Warney&#x2019;s grin signified a victory. &#x201c;Gotta <i>disagree </i>with ya there!&#x201d;<br><br>The child had gone quiet and still. And that was what Krawg would remember for the rest of his troubled life&#x2013;the moment when her eyes gathered sunset&#x2019;s burning hues and flickered with some element he had never seen; the way she rested, as though commanded to surrender by some voice only she could hear; the way he clenched his jaw, made his decision.<br><br>A wave of wind carried a few slow leaves, a shower of twirling seedpods from the violet trees, spiders on newly flung strands, and a hint of distant music&#x2013;the Early Evening Verse sung by the watchman of House Abascar to mark the dusk of the day.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, our backs are strapped now.

If I do, some officer&#x2019;ll ride through here and stomp her into the ground. We&#x2019;ve got to take her. And hide her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ballyworms!&#x201d;Warney shuddered. &#x201c;You &#x2019;n&#x2019; me &#x2019;n a Northchild &#x2019;n&#x2019; all!&#x201d; A commotion erupted just south of the marsh. First came a three-toned bellow, which the Gatherers recognized as the complaint of a vawn, one of the duty officers&#x2019; reptilian steeds. Then came the din of crushed bracken and shaken trees. It was certainly an officer come to measure their progress.<br><br>Krawg bent low and lifted the naked child by the arms. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s harmless. Didn&#x2019;t cast no spell on me. Didn&#x2019;t drag me off into darkness. She isn&#x2019;t a Northchild! There&#x2019;s no such thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s hurry it up then,&#x201d; said Warney, grinning in spite of his fear.<br><br>A few minutes later Krawg and Warney reached the shelter of thatched grass roofs and crooked mud walls in the woods just outside House Abascar&#x2019;s boundary.There, the kinder sort among the Gatherers would tend to the River Girl&#x2019;s needs and protect her from the dangerous sort.<br><br>Warney clapped a hand over his mouth, muffling a laugh. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t it bring back memories, Krawg? Sneakin&#x2019; off with treasure like this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Warney,&#x201d; Krawg replied, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ve never, never lifted treasure like this.&#x201d; Krawg and Warney weren&#x2019;t punished for carrying back the child. But they were &#x201c;strung up in the hangers&#x201d; and dangled from their ankles there a full day, scraping the filthy gutters of their vocabulary, when it was discovered they had returned without their designated picker-staffs.<br><b><br></b>Meanwhile, at the river&#x2019;s edge, water seeped from the soil into the footprint, turned to mud, and solidified. A mist rose, hovered over the place, then wisped away without wind to carry it. It would remain a mystery and a memory to the three men who had found it there&#x2013;the two troubled Gatherers and one other.<br><br>Just after Krawg and Warney had absconded with the child, a solitary rider emerged from the trees and sighted that damp impression in the grass.<br><br>The young rider, small and eager, dismounted and studied the outline even as it began to fade. He pulled from the earth a riverstone and touched the face of it with his fingertips, where a dull magic blurred. The stone&#x2019;s color warmed, and it softened to clay under his touch.<br><br>Sensing the magic, the crows on the cottonbeard branch shrieked and scattered.<br><br>The boy etched a mark in the stone as similar to the contours of the footprint as he could&#x2013;a sculpture, an equivalent. Then he walked up and down the banks awhile, surveying the soil. When the vawn snorted impatiently, he returned and climbed back into his ornate saddle. The two-legged steed stomped off, happy to head away from the water and into the trees.<br><br>No one knew of the rider&#x2019;s visit to the river. No one saw the record of his discovery, which he kept like a clue to a riddle. And he locked his questions up tight for fear of troubling the volatile storms within the heart of his father, the king.</p><h2>The Demon Princes, Vol. 2: The Face * The Book of Dreams (Demon Princes, 2)</h2><p><p>Jack Vance is undoubtedly one of the most gifted and versatile authors of science fiction today.

Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by a longing for his mother, he clings to the one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into a wealthy and insular art community.<br>As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love -- and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.<br><i>The Goldfinch</i> is a mesmerizing, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention. From the streets of New York to the dark corners of the art underworld, this "soaring masterpiece" examines the devastating impact of grief and the ruthless machinations of fate (Ron Charles, <i>Washington Post</i>).<br></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2013:</strong> It's hard to articulate just how much--and why--<em>The Goldfinch</em> held such power for me as a reader.&nbsp; Always a sucker for a good boy-and-his-mom story, I probably was taken in at first by the cruelly beautiful passages in which 13-year-old Theo Decker tells of the accident that killed his beloved mother and set his fate. But even when the scene shifts--first Theo goes to live with his schoolmate&#x2019;s picture-perfect (except it isn&#x2019;t) family on Park Avenue, then to Las Vegas with his father and his trashy wife, then back to a New York antiques shop--I remained mesmerized. Along with Boris, Theo&#x2019;s Ukrainian high school sidekick, and Hobie, one of the most wonderfully eccentric characters in modern literature,&nbsp;Theo--strange, grieving, effete, alcoholic and often not close to honorable Theo--had taken root in my heart.&nbsp; Still, <em>The Goldfinch</em> is more than a 700-plus page turner about a tragic loss:&nbsp;it&#x2019;s also a globe-spanning mystery about a painting that has gone missing, an examination of friendship, and a rumination on the nature of art and appearances.&nbsp;Most of all, it is a sometimes operatic, often unnerving and always moving chronicle of a certain kind of life.&nbsp;&#x201c;Things would have turned out better if she had lived,&#x201d; Theo said of his mother, fourteen years after she died.&nbsp;An understatement if ever there was one, but one that makes the selfish reader cry out:&nbsp;Oh, but then we wouldn&#x2019;t have had this brilliant book! <em>--Sara Nelson</em>Donna Tartt is the author of <i>The Goldfinch</i>, which was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, as well as the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction.

Her mother refused to accept that this was a problem they couldn't overcome, and together they worked with a young teacher until at last Bodie could read at grade level and above. </p> <p>"Both my parents instilled their can-do outlook on life.

They settled in Waco, Texas, where Brock attended Baylor University. It was here that Bodie began to write fiction out of the stories she gleaned from old Texas cowboys.

On December 7th, when the attack on Pearl Harbor woke so many others to the reality of war, Stewart was already in uniform - as a private on guard duty south of San Francisco at the Army Air Corps Moffet Field.

Author Starr Smith, the intelligence officer assigned to the movie star, recounts how Stewart's first battles were with the Air Corps high command, who insisted on keeping the naturally talented pilot out of harm's way as an instructor pilot for B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators. By 1944, however, Stewart managed to get assigned to a Liberator squadron that was deploying to England to join the mighty Eighth Air Force. Once in the thick of it, he rose to command his own squadron and flew twenty combat missions, including one to Berlin.<br>&#x201c;My father would feel honored by this book.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kelly Stewart Harcourt, daughter of Jimmy Stewart<br> "We would have made Jimmy a group commander [equivalent to an army regiment] if the war had lasted another month." - General Jimmy Doolittle.<br><br> "An excellent biography of a distinguished airman and fine human being." - Roger Freeman, author of <i>The Mighty Eighth: A History of the U.S. 8th Air Force</i>.<br><br> "How wonderful it is that Starr Smith has finally directed a literary light on the personal history of Jimmy Stewart. . . .

This single hardback edition is indispensable for any would-be galactic traveller and for old and new fans of Douglas Adams, Doctor Who and bestselling science fiction books.</p><p>It's safe to say that <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> is one of the funniest science fiction novels ever written. Adams spoofs many core science fiction tropes: space travel, aliens, interstellar war--stripping away all sense of wonder and repainting them as commonplace, even silly.<p> This omnibus edition begins with <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, in which Arthur Dent is introduced to the galaxy at large when he is rescued by an alien friend seconds before Earth's destruction. Then in <i>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</i>, Arthur and his new friends travel to the end of time and discover the true reason for Earth's existence. In <i>Life, the Universe, and Everything</i>, the gang goes on a mission to save the entire universe. <i>So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</i> recounts how Arthur finds true love and "God's Final Message to His Creation." Finally, <i>Mostly Harmless</i> is the story of Arthur's continuing search for home, in which he instead encounters his estranged daughter, who is on her own quest. There's also a bonus short story, "Young Zaphod Plays It Safe," more of a vignette than a full story, which wraps up this completist's package of the Don't Panic chronicles.

Would you fight, or acquiesce, or collaborate? ... Karski was deeply patriotic and ludicrously brave ... an astonishing testament of survival&#39; Ben Macintyre, author of Operation Mincemeat It is 1939. Jan Karski, a brilliant young Polish student, enjoys a life of parties and pleasure. Then war breaks out and his familiar world is destroyed. Now he must live under a new identity, in the resistance. And, in a secret mission that could change the course of the war, he must risk his own life to try and save those of millions.</p><p>Karski was his nom de guerre; he had been born Jan Kozielewski, the youngest of eight children, in Lodz, Poland&#39;s second-largest city, on April 24, 1914. Karski was a liaison officer of the Polish underground, who infiltrated both the Warsaw Ghetto and a German concentration camp and then carried the first eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust to a mostly disbelieving Anthony Eden and Franklin Roosevelt.Jan Karski&#39;s Story of a Secret State stands in the absolute first rank of books about the resistance in World War II. If you wish to read about a man more courageous and honorable than Jan Karski I would have no idea who to recommend. Yes, it&#39;s that good. -- Alan Furst It deserves its status as a Penguin Classic, not only because it is a great historic document, but also because it&#39;s a cracking good read: Karski&#39;s adventures are worthy of the wildest spy thriller -- Nigel Jones * Telegraph * His account of his missions is an electrifying tale of false identities, near captures, spies and secret film capsules ... in human terms, Karski&#39;s account is invaluable -- Frank Trentmann * Daily Express * Story of a Secret State is now viewed as a classic insider&#39;s account of the Resistance in occupied Europe...After all the harrowing descriptions of Holocaust horrors there have been over the years from survivors of Auschwitz, Belsen, and Ravensbruck, Karski&#39;s vivid account of what he saw back in 1942 is still deeply moving. We feel his shock and incredulity that this could really be happening in 20th century &#39;civilised&#39; Europe. -- Tony Rennell * Daily Mail * The bravery of the man who risked all to tell the world about the Holocaust is truly staggering ... an extraordinary testament to Man&#39;s inhumanity to Man, and the even more remarkable courage required to resist it -- Ben McIntyre * The Times * Karski&#39;s exploration of the moral fog in which he and his colleagues operated ... made me recall thrillers like Man Hunt and Hangmen Also Die ... two episodes resemble scenes tantalisingly directed by Hitchcock ... Karski&#39;s account of the systematic brutality of the Nazi regime is literally chilling -- Peter Conrad * The Observer * Reads like the screenplay to an incredibly exciting war movie - but it is all true -- Andrew Roberts Seared with an urgency that pitches the reader into the heart of the horror -- Ben Felsenburg * Metro * His story deserves not just revival but reflection ... Karski&#39;s electrifying words still speak only too eloquently for themselves -- Marek Kohn * Independent *</p><h2>Icelandic Trolls</h2><p>For centuries, the mountain trolls used to inspire terror in the hearts of the Icelandic people. Nowadays, however, little is herad from these beings, and the old terror seems to have changed to puzzled curiosity. It has been argued that many of the old trolls have turned to stone, the usual evidence for this being the huge, moss-covered, troll-like basalt rock columns that can be found all around the countryside, standing out against the skyline. In this richly illustrated book, Brian Pilkington brings the amazing world of the trolls to life in an amusing and original fashion. The Icelandic folk legends have been used as a background, but a great deal of new and surprising information has been added concerning the living conditions, traditions and customs of these ancient creatures. The wide range of illustrations in the book all testify to this popular artist&#39;s incomparable breadth of imagination.</p><p></p><h2>Paula Deen&#39;s Southern Cooking Bible Exclusive Edition</h2><p>The NEW Classic Guide to Delicious Dishes with More Than 315 Recipes</p><p></p><h2>Leftism Revisited: From De Sade and Marx to Hitler and Pol Pot</h2><p>Argues that the leftist approach to government, based on materialism, centralization, and politicization, is opposed to freedom and true liberalism</p><p></p><h2>Down a Dark Hall</h2><p>Why does the exclusive boarding school Blackwood have only four students?<br>Kit walks the dark halls and feels a penetrating chill. What tterror waits around the next corner?</p><p>Lois Duncan is an acclaimed suspense author for young adults. She has published nearly 50 books for children, including <em>I Know What You Did Last Summer</em>, which was adapted into a highly-successful horror film, and <em>Who Killed My Daughter?</em>, a non-fiction book about the harrowing experience of her daughter's murder.It was twelve-thirty--half past midnight--on the eighth day of September, and Kit lay sprawled across the bed, writing a letter to Tracy. She knew it was late to be writing letters. If she had been at home with her light on at this hour her mother would have been rapping at the door, calling in a worried voice, "Kit? Is anything wrong, honey? It's much too late for you to be up."<br><br>At Blackwood nobody sounded a lights-off curfew, and Kit was glad. Although she had been at the school for well over a week now and was adjusting well on most counts, she still did not feel at ease at night. The light at the end of the hall had not been fixed--"It's almost impossible to get electricians to come out this far," Madame explained apologetically--and though Kit's own room was often lightened by moonlight, she could not shut out a strange nervousness about the oppressive darkness on the far side of her closed door.<br><br>She did not sleep well at Blackwood. She dreamed. She knew that she dreamed, for when she woke in the mornings the feeling of the dreams still clung to the edges of her mind, and yet in most cases she could not remember what they had been. She needed to be very sleepy to turn off the light and settle into slumber, and so she had begun to form the habit of studying and writing letters during the early part of the night.<br><br>"Dear Tracy," she wrote now, "I'm sorry to have been so long in writing. I got a note off to Mom the first day here so that she would have mail waiting for her in Cherbourg, and then I got snowed under with schoolwork. The work here is harder than it was in public school, mostly, I guess, because the classes are so small. There are only four of us here--can you believe it? Four students in the entire school! So it's almost like having private tutors. I'm taking math and science from Professor Farley, a dear old goat of a man with a funny little bear --really sweet--and literature from Madame Duret. And piano from <i>Jules!</i> I guess I'd better put a row of exclamation marks--!!!!!!!--to give you an idea of what <i>he</i> looks like. All of a sudden I'm getting interested in music.<br><br>"The three other girls here are very different. My favorite is Sandy Mason--she's shy and quiet, but nice, and I've started to stir her up a little with plans to short-sheet the other girls' beds and maybe raid the kitchen one night and bring the food up to the rooms for a midnight feast. Lynda Hannah and Ruth Stark knew each other before. They went to the same prep school last year, and when Ruth's parents decided to switch her to Blackwood, Lynda persuaded her mother to let her change schools too. Ruth is homely but very bright, and Lynda is the opposite, awfully pretty but not much in the brains department. They seem to balance each other.<br><br>"I still don't understand how we four were selected. Professor Farley says we have the special attributes the were looking for in their students, but I can't imagine what they might be. We seem to have nothing in common with each other, and I don't see how you could have failed to get accepted if I was. I tried to ask Madame Duret about it, but she only said that she didn't discuss test results.<br><br>"I wish I could say I like it here. In a way I do. Everybody's very nice to me, and the classes are interesting. But there's something--I don't know how to put it into words, and you'd probably laugh if I did--but I've got this creepy feeling that something's wrong. I felt it first when we entered the gates and started up the driveway, and I feel it more and more every day, as though--"<br><br>Somebody screamed. Somewhere in the blackness on the far side of the door. It was a funny scream, choked off in an instant as though a hand had been pressed suddenly to cover the mouth.<br><br>It went through Kit like an electric shock. Her hand jerked, and the pen made a lurch across the page, so that the word "though" ran off the side of the paper.<br><br>Pulling herself upright on the bed, she sat, tense and shaken, listening. There was nothing but silence.<br><br>But I heard it, she told herself. I know I heard it.<br><br>Somewhere in the quiet dormitory someone had shrieked. In pain? In terror? Perhaps only from a nightmare, and yet, perhaps for some other reason. For--<i>help?</i><br><br>I won't, Kit thought. I can't. I just can't open that door and go out there.<br><br>And yet, what if one of the other girls were ill? No one screamed without reason. Was someone lying even now in one of the rooms along the hall, wretched with fear or in physical agony, praying that her cry had been heard and would be answered?<br><br>Slowly, as though impelled by something other than her own will, Kit got off the bed and crossed the room and opened the door. The terrible blackness of the hall stretched before her, lessened only by the patch of lamplight that fell from her own doorway. Beyond this there was nothing but stillness and dark.<br><br>Kit stood with one hand on the door jamb, listening. The only sounds she could hear were the thud of her own heart and the quick, sharp noise of her breathing.<br><br>Perhaps I imagined it, she thought. Perhaps I dozed off a little, there on the bed, and dreamed.<br><br>And then she heard it--not a scream this time but a little moaning sound, half a sob, half a wail. It seemed to come from the end of the hall where Sandy had her room.<br><br>Well, that does it, Kit told herself resignedly. I have to go.<br><br>Drawing a deep breath as if in readiness for a dive into icy water, she stood poised for a moment on the edge of the patch of light. Then, bracing herself, she stepped out into the darkness.</p><h2>Tiger and Tom and Other Stories for Boys (Character Classics, Vol. 2)</h2><p>The stories in this compilation were found in nearly every orphange in our land during the late 1800&#39;s.

But in a&nbsp;very short time he would ignite a revolution of conscience in his native Poland that would ultimately lead to the collapse of European communism and death of the Soviet Union. What even fewer people knew was that the KGB, the Polish Secret Police, and the East German Stasi had been waging a dangerous, decades-long war against&nbsp;Wojty�a&nbsp;and the Vatican itself. Weigel, with unprecedented access to many Soviet-era documents, chronicles John Paul&#x2019;s struggle against the dark forces of communism. <br>&nbsp;<br>Moreover, Weigel recounts the tumultuous last years of John Paul&#x2019;s life as he dealt with a crippling illness as well as the &#x201c;new world disorder&#x201d; and revelations about corruption within the Catholic Church. Weigel&#x2019;s thought-provoking biography of John Paul II concludes with a probing and passionate assessment of a man who lived his life as a witness to hope in service to the Christian ideals he embraced.</p><p>GEORGE WEIGEL, Distinguished Senior Fellow of Washington&#x2019;s Ethics and Public Policy Center, is one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on the Catholic Church.

After fighting with Polish partisans in the last days of World War I, he served with Polish forces in the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-20: a largely unknown affair that saved newly resurrected Poland from Bolshevik conquest and prevented the Red Army from blazing its way across war-exhausted Europe. Decorated twice for heroism in the struggle to defend Poland's new independence, Pilecki was mustered out and spent the interwar years as a farmer; he married and fathered two children.<br><br>Less than a week before the outbreak of World War II, Pilecki took command of a cavalry platoon in the 19th Polish Infantry Division. After two weeks of fighting against the German invaders, the division was demobilized in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Poland; Pilecki and his commander, Jan Wlodarkiewicz, went to Warsaw and launched the Tajna Armia Polska [Secret Polish Army] as an underground resistance movement. In 1940, its 8,000 members were incorporated into the Armia Krajowa [Home Army, or AK]: successor to the Polish military in occupied and partitioned Poland, and the fighting arm of the London-based Polish government-in-exile.<br><br>Later that year, Pilecki brought his AK superiors a daring plan: he would get himself arrested and sent to Konzentrationslager Auschwitz, located in that portion of Poland that had been incorporated into the Third Reich. There, he proposed to organize prisoner resistance, collect intelligence, and get it out to the AK, which had ways of transmitting such information to London. The superiors agreed. So, under the nom de guerre "Tomasz Serafinski," Pilecki deliberately got himself caught in a Gestapo sweep of civilians; he was arrested, tortured, and then dispatched to the labor camp at Auschwitz, where he became prisoner 4859. At Auschwitz, Pilecki got busy organizing the Zwiazek Organizacji Wojskowej, or Union of Military Organizations [ZOW], which worked to improve prisoner morale, distribute smuggled clothing, food, and medical supplies, and train a resistance movement capable of taking over the camp in the event of an Allied attack. Contacts were maintained with local Polish patriots, and intelligence on camp operations was gathered. By 1941, ZOW had managed to build a radio, and Pilecki's intelligence reports on life, death, and torture at Auschwitz I got out to Polish resistance and thence to London. The prisoners' hope was that these reports would lead to a joint attack on the camp by the Home Army and the Western Allies, perhaps using the Polish Parachute Brigade that had been formed in exile.<br><br>After two years, however, Pilecki decided to escape and make his way to AK headquarters; he wanted to make the case in person for a relief attack on the Auschwitz complex, which had now been expanded to include the gas chambers and crematoria at Birkenau (sometimes known as Auschwitz II). With the help of local patriots, he made good his escape in April 1943 and eventually worked his way to Warsaw. His reports on Auschwitz were considered exaggerated by the British, who seemed incapable of imagining mass murder on an industrial scale; and without Allied air support, the Home Army leadership concluded, an attack on the concentration and extermination camps was impossible.<br><br>Pilecki then joined a unit within the AK that, in addition to its anti-Nazi activities, was dedicated to resisting a postwar Soviet takeover of Poland&#x2013;a possibility not unlikely in light of evolving Allied strategy. After the Warsaw Uprising broke out on August 1, 1944, Pilecki initially fought anonymously as a private. Later, on revealing his true rank, he took command of an important sector that held out for two weeks against fierce German assault. When the AK authorities surrendered after sixty-three days of epic struggle, Pilecki was captured and spent the rest of the war in two German POW compounds. After these camps were liberated, he joined the famous Polish II Corps, victors at Monte Cassino and in Normandy's Falaise Pocket. The commander of the Polish II Corps, General Wladyslaw Anders, had another mission for the intrepid officer who had demonstrated such remarkable courage and ingenuity for five years. Pilecki was asked to return to a Poland being strangled by the Red Army and the NKVD (predecessor to the KGB); there, he was to reestablish his intelligence network and report to the government-in-exile in London, which still claimed legal authority over Polish affairs. It seemed another futile mission, but Pilecki agreed to go, and in addition to performing his assigned intelligence duties wrote a study of Auschwitz. When the government-in-exile decided that its situation was hopeless and ordered the remaining resistance fighters to return to civilian life or try to escape to the West, Witold Pilecki dismantled his intelligence networks but remained in Poland. In 1947, he began collecting information about NKVD and Red Army atrocities against Polish patriots, often former members of the AK or Polish II Corps.<br><br>Arrested by the Polish communist secret police in May 1947, Pilecki was brutally tortured prior to his trial, but revealed nothing that would compromise others. The suborned "evidence" used against him at his March 1948 show trial came from, among others, a fellow Auschwitz survivor, Jozef Cyrankiewicz, who would later become one of communist Poland's prime ministers. Pilecki freely admitted that he had passed information to Polish II Corps headquarters, which he believed to be his duty as an officer. Falsely charged with plotting assassinations, which he denied, Witold Pilecki was given a capital sentence and shot on May 25, 1948, at the Mokotow prison in Warsaw. His grave was never found; it is thought that the body may have been disposed of at a garbage dump near a local cemetery.<br><br>This was the Poland in which Karol Wojtyla, whom the world would come to know as Pope John Paul II, was ordained a Catholic priest in 1946: a country in which men of unblemished honor and extraordinary heroism could be convicted as traitors and murdered by communist thugs, their bodies tossed onto garbage heaps. The forces that created, and brutally maintained, this particular heart of darkness were the nemesis&#x2013;the seemingly invincible opponent&#x2013;against which Karol Wojtyla contended for more than three decades.1<br><b>The Time and the Place</b><br><br>By most historical accounts, Poland was something of a bit player on the twentieth-century global stage: rarely a protagonist, often a victim, a country whose heroic virtues seemed to go hand in glove with a striking incapacity for governance and diplomacy. Yet if we define the "twentieth century" not by conventional chronology but by its central drama, the truth of the matter is that Poland played a pivotal role at several crucial moments between 1914 and&nbsp;1991: those seventy-seven years of Western civilizational crisis that began when the guns of August launched World War I and ended when one of the greatest effects of the Great War, the Soviet Union, disappeared.<br><br>By Lenin's own admission, the "Miracle on the Vistula" in 1920&#x2013;in which the Polish forces of Marshal Jozef Pilsudski repulsed the Red Army cavalry and thrust Trotsky's forces back into Russia proper&#x2013;was a "gigantic, unheard-of defeat" for communist world revolution.2 Nineteen years later, Poland was the first European state to offer armed resistance to Adolf Hitler, demonstrating the imperative of defending freedom against totalitarianism rather than attempting to appease its appetites. Fifty years after that, in 1989, Poland once again asserted its right to freedom against seemingly insuperable odds, and became the fulcrum of a nonviolent revolution that swept European communism into the dustbin of history while giving birth to a new, democratic European order.3<br><br>The Poland in which Father Karol Wojtyla would spend the first years of his priesthood was a Poland that had been dramatically&#x2013;some would say, "completely"&#x2013;changed by the Second World War, and by the postwar arrangements agreed to by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.4 It had been picked up and moved several hundred kilometers to the west, losing territories that had been Polish for centuries and gaining lands that would be a bone of contention with postwar Germany (and an excuse for Soviet hegemony) for decades. Politically, the Poland that emerged from World War II was a wholly owned subsidiary of the USSR, a central piece in the postwar Soviet imperial puzzle and the land bridge to communist East Germany. Postwar Poland was ethnically more Polish than Poland had ever been, its Jews having been destroyed in the Holocaust and its Ukrainians incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Culturally, postwar Poland was arguably the most intensely Catholic country on the planet, not only because of genocides and population transfers, but because the Catholic Church, which suffered terribly during World War II, had emerged with its honor intact and its historic role as the repository of Polish national identity and memory confirmed. Economically, the country was a ruin, having been one of the battlegrounds on which two totalitarian powers had fought an armed struggle to the death. Psychologically, Poland was dazed and depressed; fear stalked the land even after the country's putative liberation. One-fifth of Poland's prewar population had died between 1939 and 1945. The survivors sensed that the flower of the nation had been sacrificed in the war Poland lost twice, even as the new postwar communist order was imposed with a ruthlessness matching that of the previous, Nazi occupying power.<br><br>Yet Poland had somehow survived World War II&#x2013;as Poland had, somehow, been reborn in the waning days of World War I, after 123 years of exile from the political map of Europe. It was a close-run thing. Crushed in September 1939 between the totalitarian pincers of the Wehrmacht and the Red Army, the Second Polish Republic was in mortal peril. As one historian puts it, by October 1939 "the Polish state . . . faced the threat of not only total military defeat, but also the loss of legal and constitutional continuity. Almost its entire territory was controlled by an enemy alliance, and its constitutional authorities had been incapacitated by an erstwhile ally."5 That ally, Great Britain, would continue to regard Poland as a diplomatic headache throughout the war, despite the heroic contributions of Polish squadrons to British victory in the Battle of Britain, and of Polish infantry and armor to Allied victories in Italy and Normandy.<br><br>Poland's postwar fate was sealed by one event and one decision. The event was the Battle of Kursk, the greatest armored battle in history, which, in August 1943, effectively ended the German invasion of the Soviet Union and set in motion the long, bloody process by which the Red Army fought its way to Berlin. The decision was the strategic choice made by Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt at QUADRANT, their Quebec City conference that same month. By agreeing to the American plan to invade Hitler's Festung Europa from the west, across the English Channel (rather than from the south, through the Balkans), the Western Allies ensured that Poland would be overrun by the Soviet army rather than liberated by Anglo-American forces. During the latter part of the war, the incapacities and internal quarrels of the Polish government-in-exile were not inconsiderable. Yet those Polish failures were, in a sense, as irrelevant to the great power Realpolitik game being played at the "Big Three" conferences in Tehran and Yalta as were the heroics of Polish RAF pilots during the Battle of Britain and of Polish soldiers at Monte Cassino: cursed by the geographical reality of being a broad, flat plain between Germany and Russia, Poland was now a pawn in the emerging, bipolar, and deadly chess match between the Soviet Union and the West.<br><br>1. The story of Witold Pilecki and his persecution by Polish communists was not publicly revealed until the collapse of communism in 1989. Pilecki and others falsely condemned were legally rehabilitated by Poland's first postcommunist government on October 1, 1990. In 1995, Witold Pilecki was posthumously awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta. A Polish Foundation, Fundacja Paradis Judaeorum, now works to have May 25, the day Pilecki was shot, declared a European Union holiday, "The Day of the Heroes of the Struggle with Totalitarianism."<br><br>An extensive literature on Pilecki now exists, and his remarkable Auschwitz report is available online.

Inspired by a lifelong appreciation of the music that borders on obsession, Cohen&#x2019;s chronicle of the band is informed by the rigorous views of a kid who grew up on the music and for whom the Stones will always be the greatest rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll band of all time.<br><br>The story begins at the beginning: the fateful meeting of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards on a train platform in 1961&#x2014;and goes on to span decades, with a focus on the golden run&#x2014;from the albums <i>Beggars Banquet</i> (1968) to <i>Exile on</i> <i>Main Street</i> (1972)&#x2014;when the Stones were prolific and innovative and at the height of their powers. Cohen is equally as good on the low points as the highs, and he puts his finger on the moments that not only defined the Stones as gifted musicians schooled in the blues and arguably the most innovative songwriters of their generation, but as the avatars of so much in our modern culture.<br><br> In the end, though, after the drugs and the girlfriends and the rows, there is the music. <i>The Sun &amp; The Moon &amp; The Rolling Stones</i> makes you want to listen to every song in your library anew and search out the obscure gems that you&#x2019;ve yet to hear.

After five highly scrutinized decades of music, drugs, busts, death, jealousy, women, and exile, there's not much new to say that hasn't been broadcast through countless books, movies, articles, and court records. But Rich Cohen's <em>The Sun &amp; The Moon &amp; The Rolling Stones</em>--based on his coverage of the band for <em>Rolling Stone</em> magazine in the 1990s, as well as his own lifelong obsession--asserts itself as an essential addition to the canon, earning a place on the same shelf as Keith Richards' <em>Life</em> and the Maysles brothers' harrowing Altamont doc, <em>Gimme Shelter</em>. The success is in the storytelling. Yes, it's filled with detail and stories familiar to any fan, but also driven by prose fit for his gonzo heritage: he's wild within reason and funny in the Thompson style, unafraid of contrarian pronouncements and first-person perspective, with a high hit-rate for memorable, original sentences (to which my dog-eared galley attests). Cohen, who pulled off a similar feat with <em>Monsters</em>, his book about the 1985 Chicago Bears, understands that writing--and reading--works when it's personal, a little bit transgressive, and a hell of a lot of fun. Just like the Stones. --<em>Jon Foro</em><b>Rich Cohen</b> is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Tough Jews</i>, <i>The Avengers, Monsters</i>, and (with Jerry Weintraub) <i>When I Stop Talking, You&#x2019;ll Know I&#x2019;m Dead</i>.

A squire serves and learns from a seasoned knight for four years, then faces a final test. That final test is the Ordeal, which takes place in a magical room called the Chamber. There, a squire encounters the parts of him or herself that the Chamber deems to be the most difficult to face&#x2014;be they fears, failings, or unrepented wicked deeds. Does Kel have what it takes to survive?</p><p>In Book 3 of Tamora Pierce's <i>Protector of the Small</i> sequence, 14-year-old Keladry of Mindelan is ready to begin training as a squire after undergoing four grueling years as the first girl to be officially educated as a page. Disappointed at first that Lady Alanna (whom we first met in the Song of the Lioness Quartet series) does not choose her, Kel is delighted when gruff, good-natured, down-to-earth Lord Raoul takes her on. The next four years prove to be tough but happy, for the most part, as Raoul and most of the others in the King's Own (a corps of 300 men--299 now, plus Kel--that enforces the law and helps local nobles deal with problems such as centaur attacks and forest robberies) treat Kel as an equal. Throughout, Kel is physically and mentally preparing herself for the final test in the Chamber of the Ordeal, in which fourth-year squires must successfully face their greatest fears before becoming knights.<p> In this sequel to <i>First Test: Protector of the Small</i> and <i>Page: Protector of the Small</i>, Kel continues to be an admirable role model: stoutly loyal, strong, independent, honest, yet very real in her fears and weaknesses. Romance lurks for the budding adolescent as she develops a crush on one fellow and begins a sweet kissing-only relationship with another, after a very frank discussion about sex with her mother. Although the buildup to the Ordeal is watered down a bit by Kel's periodic visits to the Chamber door for a taste of what's to come, overall, this latest in Pierce's series is a rousing tale of chivalry and heroism that any reader will be sorely challenged to put down.

There are tiny workers crawling around in our bodies! Or at least there are in Stephen Biesty's incredibly detailed anatomical cross sections of everything from the circulatory system to the human brain. The little people are there to show you how things work: the tiny tunnelers represent blood, hormones, the immune system, nerves, muscles, and organ "home teams." As they cavort around the exquisitely intricate drawings, Richard Platt, a most charming companion, accompanies us on our journey through the body's systems--into the ear, for example: <blockquote> Feeling our way along a shiny bundle of nerve fibers, we squeezed through a small, circular hole where the fibers branched. Should we take the left or right fork? We flipped a coin and chose the left. It led to a narrow tunnel, like the inside of a seashell.... Only one part of Steve's body looked like this: the inner ear. </blockquote> One of the best body system cross sections is the <i>huge</i> centerfold exposing the inner workings of the digestive system from mouth to... end. Then again, there's the fascinating-yet-disgusting rolled back tongue, the awesome opened-up eye, and the sliced skeleton--12 big drawings in all. Take a trip through <i>Stephen Biesty's Incredible Body</i> and have fun while you learn. (Ages 9 to 12)Stephen Biesty is an artist of phenomenal talent with remarkable visual skills. As a child he spent hours drawing castles, knights at battle, and ferocious Vikings, taking inspiration from films such as Spartacus, Ben Hur, and Anthony and Cleopatra, which fueled his already fertile imagination. <p>In 1980, he attended Brighton Polytechnic where he specialized in historical reconstruction illustration and developed a particular interest in what went on inside castles and other ancient buildings. After graduating from Brighton with a BA in Graphic Design, Stephen earned an MA in Graphic Design at City of Birmingham Polytechnic working further in historical reconstruction. </p><p>Stephen became a full-time illustrator in 1985 and has since worked on a variety of information books for adults and children. It took Stephen two and a half years to draw the wonderful illustrations for the best-selling Stephen Biesty's Incredible Cross-Sections, which was published in 1992. That volume was the inspiration for a new range of cross-section books which include Man-of-War (1993), Castle (1994), Incredible Pop-Up Cross-Sections (1995), Incredible Explosions (1996), Incredible Everything (1997), Incredible Body (1998), and DK Amazing Pop-Up 3D Time Scape (1999).

Kennedy were assassinated, and the computer revolution was begun.&nbsp; The result is nothing less than extraordinary.</p></p><p>Martin Gilbert, official biographer of Winston Churchill, is a British historian of the highest credentials. He attempts here in 1,000 short pages to encapsulate the tumultuous events of the second half of the 20th century. In straightforward language, he presents a chronological narrative of what happened around the world. Each year is given its own chapter. His direct style recaptures the immediacy of the epoch-making events he describes, and the book sometimes reads like a breaking news report. The author maintains a laudable objectivity: The material is not Eurocentric but attempts to provide a genuine world overview. Besides politics, he includes stories with social significance, such as environmental disasters, the plight of refugees, even the sociological impact of birth-control pills. Thirty-six maps clarify accounts of military campaigns and international and ethnic rivalries, and 52 photographs present iconic images of the period. What Gilbert cannot do within this narrative format is analyze or comment at length on the episodes he is describing. Themes such as the growing awareness of human rights or the increasingly interrelated nature of complex global phenomena emerge almost by accident; they are not defined and developed, and the book becomes a prodigious procession of unfolding events. The value of <i>A History of the Twentieth Century</i> is as an encyclopedia, as an easily accessible store of raw material: in this sense it is a useful addition to the amateur historian's library. <i>--John Stevenson</i><p>Martin Gilbert is Winston Churchill's biographer and the author of eight acclaimed books on the Holocaust.

A certain amount of whining allows for some venting of reasonable pain, disappointment, fear, frustration, or frank rage. However, staying stuck in whining mode can become a life-long problem. This is where Dr. Laura steps in with <i>Stop Whining, Start Living</i> to help folks conquer the temptation to retreat from living life to the fullest. </p> <p> As she reveals in her introduction, "No matter what you've suffered or continue to suffer, while you are alive you have the opportunity to get something from this life, and I'm going to do my best to help you with that. . . . I know of what I speak, as this has been my torturous journey also." Building on the principles developed during her long career as a licensed marriage and family therapist, and addressing the chronic struggles of so many of her listeners and readers, Dr. Laura issues an important message in the no-nonsense but compassionate voice that is her trademark: If you don't like your life, quit talking about your unhappiness and try to fix it, no matter how difficult or impossible your situation seems. </p> <p> While it is healthy to vent occasionally, endless rumination on the negative only keeps you paralyzed in misery, reinforces hopelessness, and demoralizes those around you who feel helpless to bring any happiness into your life. Instead, <i>Stop Whining, Start Living</i> encourages "whiners" to reject negative thoughts, emotions, and attitudes; shift perspective; open up to gratitude and goodness; and embrace obligations to loved ones and the world in general. Before long, just doing what you're supposed to be doing--instead of moaning about why you can't or won't or shouldn't fulfill your responsibilities--will have you feeling better about yourself and will uplift your interactions with family, friends, colleagues, and even complete strangers in incredible ways. </p> <p> Illustrated by calls and letters from members of Dr. Laura's huge international audience, <i>Stop Whining, Start Living</i> features brave testimonials from real human beings facing real challenges. These folks have benefited enormously from Dr. Laura's powerful lessons. </p> <p> <i>Stop Whining, Start Living</i> gives readers stuck in their suffering the jump start they need to break out of reactive mode and get proactive, moving in the direction of a joyful, meaningful, happy, fulfilling, and purposeful future. Everyone can use a kick in the pants sometimes, and Dr. Laura, who "preaches, teaches, and nags" to millions every day on her radio program, is here to deliver it! </p> <p> <strong>Questions for Dr. Laura</strong> </p><p> </p><p> <strong>Question:</strong> How and why does whining get in the way of living? </p><p><strong>Dr. Laura:</strong> Whining as an immediate response to any sort of pain (physical, psychological, emotional, interpersonal) is normal and potentially helpful since venting helps get us some loving and supportive attention which "softens the blow." Staying in whining mode makes us ignore options for repair or growth and interferes with us squeezing joy out of every precious day. </p><p> <strong>Question:</strong> <i>Stop Whining, Start Living</i> assures readers that change is possible with commitment and willpower. But what can people do to break the habit of suffering? </p><p><strong>Dr. Laura:</strong> Solutions to serious problems don&#x2019;t always have to be...well...serious! I have had people on the line who I&#x2019;ve made sing and/or dance while live on the radio. It is almost impossible to be sad while "movin&#x2019; to the music"! I&#x2019;ve told listeners to turn on their radios or iPods to whatever music moves them (for me it is oldies rock) for fifteen minutes. Distraction and physicality do a lot to alleviate a negative mood. From there folks need to move into being a blessing unto others. </p><p> <strong>Question:</strong> Is it ever okay to whine? If so, for how long and under what circumstances? </p><p><strong>Dr. Laura:</strong> As I wrote in <i>Stop Whining, Start Living</i>, I reserve the right to whine about some frustration, disappointment or assault for between one and four days max. After that I&#x2019;ve become boring to myself and everyone around me. Constant whining takes full attention, which means you can&#x2019;t smell the roses. And, I only whine to someone who cares, will be sympathetic, and who will then help me get goin&#x2019; again. </p><p> <strong>Question:</strong> When&#x2019;s the last time you, Dr. Laura, had a whining episode and how did you snap out of it? </p><p><strong>Dr. Laura:</strong> It was just the other day! I got some thoroughly aggravating news and stomped around whining for a couple of hours. What always sets me straight is turning on my microphone. Why? Because for three hours each weekday I get to help people do and be better in their lives. I hear the respect and trust they&#x2019;ve developed for me after months or years of listening to my program. I hear the switch snap in their brains as they "get" what it is they have to do or be to improve their lives. I hear the gratitude for my service. All of that is humbling and reboots my attitude. I am grateful to be of service and that more than makes up for whatever annoyance plagued my day. I also go sailing or take a power hike with my dog, BeBe. </p><p> <strong>Question:</strong> What can a person gain from giving up complaining? </p><p><strong>Dr. Laura:</strong> I always tell folks that it is a dear shame to not enjoy a great plate of spaghetti and meatballs because you&#x2019;re disappointed in the number of meatballs. You gain dinner! </p><p> <strong>Question:</strong> <i>The Proper Care and Feeding of Marriage</i>, your last bestseller, dealt with all the forces undermining today&#x2019;s marriages and the kind, loving actions, thoughts and behaviors at the core of every successful partnership. How does <i>Stop Whining, Start Living</i> build upon this foundation? </p><p><strong>Dr. Laura:</strong> <i>Stop Whining, Start Living</i> doesn&#x2019;t build upon the foundation of <i>The Proper Care and Feeding of Marriage</i>--it IS the foundation. To look at your spouse and see some things that annoy you and focus in on only those aspects of their being and your relationship is marriage and spouse abuse! To see some things that annoy you and to say to yourself, "Small price to pay to have someone to love and to love me," is to stop whining and start loving. </p><p> <strong>Question:</strong> You advise readers to just say &#x2018;no&#x2019; to hurt feelings. What do you mean? </p><p><strong>Dr. Laura:</strong> Upset feelings can lead us to behaviors of either retaliation, self-abuse or perpetual negative rumination--if you let them. Any of those behaviors feed back into growing those upset feelings and letting them take solid root. The term "acceptance" seems so incomprehensible to so many people. Acceptance means that you stop fighting "it". When people call in their 30&#x2019;s and 40&#x2019;s still complaining that some parent, friend, or relative isn&#x2019;t giving/doing what they&#x2019;d like...I tell them it is time to stop being surprised that an alligator isn&#x2019;t friendly in the bathtub. It&#x2019;s an alligator--and that&#x2019;s how alligators behave. Meanwhile, the new lovely people and circumstances of their lives are lower priority because they&#x2019;re still fighting for the "old stuff" to miraculously change--as though that would really make any true difference in their lives. I tell them to let go of their end of the tug-of-war and walk away towards what is and can be.</p><p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger, a licensed marriage and family therapist, is one of the most popular talk-show hosts in radio history and the only woman to win the prestigious Marconi Award for syndicated radio.

As a man he found himself undercover for God. Brother Andrew was his name and for decades his life story, recounted in God&#x2019;s Smuggler, has awed and inspired millions. The bestseller tells of the young Dutch factory worker&#x2019;s incredible efforts to transport Bibles across closed borders&#x2014;and the miraculous ways in which God provided for him every step of the way. Revell and Chosen now reintroduce this powerful story with two new releases: a 35th anniversary edition and The Narrow Road, an expanded youth edition. Both contain a new foreword and afterword. The youth edition also features information about ministry to the persecuted church today, including country profiles, quotes from Christians in underground churches, "what if" scenarios based on real-life threats they face, and stories from others who have participated in Brother Andrew&#x2019;s Bible-smuggling work. Brother Andrew&#x2019;s story remains as inspiring today as it was thirty-five years ago, and with these new releases it will motivate a whole new generation to risk everything to follow God&#x2019;s call.</p><p>"This road that we travel May it be the straight and narrow God give us peace and grace from you" &#x2014;from the song "This Road" by Jars of Clay Jars of Clay gained a new perspective on the body of Christ as they sang these words to members of underground churches in China and Vietnam. There they came face to face with brothers and sisters who are daily threatened with imprisonment, beatings, even death, for their faith in Jesus Christ. The band now offers "This Road" as an anthem of support for Christians around the world, making it a perfect fit for the stories found in The Narrow Road. Begin with the incredible autobiography of Brother Andrew. Since 1955, this remarkable man has risked his life to help persecuted Christians by smuggling Bibles into countries where owning or distributing them is strictly forbidden. His report, packed with dangerous adventures and amazing turns, testifies of God's miraculous provision for those who risk it all. Journey also into places still hostile to Christians-with profiles on courageous champions of the faith. Meet teens and others across the globe who, like the believers Jars of Clay visited, are mercilessly persecuted for their faith, yet display extraordinary joy. Their stories, along with Brother Andrew's, will forever change the way you walk the narrow road.&#34;Our culture has been blinded from a true vision of the way God works in suffering. There is a world beyond the safety of our insular church culture. There are miracles and tragedies, passion and suffering, great joy and indescribable injustice. . . .&#34; -from the foreword by Daniel Haseltine of Jars of Clay</p><h2>The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry, and Invention</h2><p>If all measures of human advancement in the last hundred centuries were plotted on a graph, they would show an almost perfectly flat line&#x2014;until the eighteenth century, when the Industrial Revolution would cause the line to shoot straight up, beginning an almost uninterrupted march of progress.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In <b>The Most Powerful Idea in the World</b>, William Rosen tells the story of the men responsible for the Industrial Revolution and the machine that drove it&#x2014;the steam engine. In the process he tackles the question that has obsessed historians ever since: What made eighteenth-century Britain such fertile soil for inventors? Rosen&#x2019;s answer focuses on a simple notion that had become enshrined in British law the century before: that people had the right to own and profit from their ideas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The result was a period of frantic innovation revolving particularly around the promise of steam power. Rosen traces the steam engine&#x2019;s history from its early days as a clumsy but sturdy machine, to its coming-of-age driving the wheels of mills and factories, to its maturity as a transporter for people and freight by rail and by sea. Along the way we enter the minds of such inventors as Thomas Newcomen and James Watt, scientists including Robert Boyle and Joseph Black, and philosophers John Locke and Adam Smith&#x2014;all of whose insights, tenacity, and ideas transformed first a nation and then the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>William Rosen is a masterly storyteller with a keen eye for the &#x201c;aha!&#x201d; moments of invention and a gift for clear and entertaining explanations of science. <b>The Most Powerful Idea in the World</b> will appeal to readers fascinated with history, science, and the hows and whys of innovation itself.<br></p><p>William Rosen, the author of the award-winning history <i>Justinian&#x2019;s Flea: Plague, Empire, and the Birth of Europe</i>,<i> </i>was an editor and publisher at Macmillan, Simon &amp; Schuster, and the Free Press for nearly twenty-five years. He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.<i>Chapter One</i><br>CHANGES IN THE ATMOSPHERE<br><br>Concerning how a toy built in Alexandria failed to inspire, and how a glass tube made in italy succeeded; the spectacle of two german hemispheres attached to sixteen german horses; and the critical importance of nothing at all to get to crofton from Birmingham, you take the M5 south about sixty miles to Brockworth and then change to the A417, which meanders first east, then southwest, then southeast, for another forty-six miles, changing, for no apparent reason, into the A419, and then the A436. In Burbage, you turn left at the Wolfhall Road and follow it another mile, across the railroad tracks and over the canal. The reason for making this three-hour journey (not counting time for wrong turns) is visible for the last quarter-mile or so: two red brick buildings next to a sixty-foot-tall chimney.<br><br>The Crofton Pump Station in Wiltshire contains the oldest steam engine in the world still doing the job for which it was designed. Every weekend, its piston-operated beam pumps twelve tons of water a minute into six eight-foot-high locks along the hundred-mile-long Kennet and Avon Canal. The engine itself, number 42B-the figure "B. 42" is still visible on the engine beam-is so called because it was the second engine with a forty-two-inch cylinder produced by the Birmingham manufacturer Boulton &amp; Watt. It was entered in the company's order book on January 11, 1810, and installed almost precisely two years later. Except for a brief time in the 1960s, it has run continuously ever since.<br><br>First encounters with steam power are usually unexpected, inadvertent, and explosive; the cap flying off a defective teakettle, for example. No surprise there; the expansive property of water when heated past a certain point was known for thousands of years before that point was ever measured, and to this day it's what drives the turbine that generates most of our electricity, including that used to power the light by which you are reading this book. The relationship between the steam power of a modern turbine and the kind used to pump the water out of the Kennet and Avon Canal is, however, anything but direct. By comparison, the mechanism of engine 42B is a thing of Rube Goldberg-like complexity, with levers, cylinders, and pistons yoked together by a dozen different linkages, connecting rods, gears, cranks, and cams, all of them moving in a terrifyingly complicated dance that is at once fascinating, and eerily quiet- enough to occupy the mechanically inclined visitor, literally, for hours. When the engine is "in steam," it somehow causes the twenty- six-foot-long cast iron beams to move, in the words of Charles Dickens, "monotonously up and down, like the head of an elephant in melancholy madness."<br><br>There is, however, something odd about the beams, or rather about the pistons to which they are attached. The pistons aren't just being driven up by the steam below them. The power stroke is also down: toward the steam chamber. Something is sucking the pistons downward. Or, more accurately, nothing is: a vacuum.<br><br>Using steam to create vacuum was not the sort of insight that came an instant after watching a teakettle lid go flying. It depended, instead, on a journey of discovery and diffusion that took more than sixteen centuries. By all accounts the trip began sometime in the first century ce, on the west side of the Nile Delta, in the Egyptian city of Alexandria, at the Mouseion, the great university at which first Euclid and then Archimedes studied, and where, sometime around 60 CE, another great mathematician lived and worked, one whose name is virtually always the first associated with the steam engine: Heron of Alexandria.<br><br>The Encyclopaedia Britannica entry for Heron-occasionally, Hero-is somewhat scant on birth and death dates; as is often the case with figures from an age less concerned with such trivia, it uses the abbreviation "fl." for the latin floruit, or "flourished." And flourish he did. Heron's text on geometry, written sometime in the first century but not rediscovered until the end of the nineteenth, is known as the Metrika, and includes both the formula for calculating the area of a triangle and a method for extracting square roots. He was even better known as the inventor of a hydraulic fountain, a puppet theater using automata, a wind-powered organ, and, most relevantly for engine 42B, the aeolipile, a reaction engine that consisted of a hollow sphere with two elbow-shaped tubes attached on opposite ends, mounted on an axle connected to a tube suspended over a cauldron of water. As the water boiled, steam rose through the pipe into the sphere and escaped through the tubes, causing the sphere to rotate.<br><br>Throughout most of human history, successful inventors, unless wealthy enough to retain their amateur status, have depended on patronage, which they secured either by entertaining their betters or glorifying them (sometimes both). Heron was firmly in the first camp, and by all accounts, the aeolipile was regarded as a wonder by the wealthier classes of Alexandria, which was then one of the richest and most sophisticated cities in the world. Despite the importance it is given in some scientific histories, though, its real impact was nil. No other steam engines were inspired by it, and its significance is therefore a reminder of how quickly inventions can vanish when they are produced for a society's toy department.<br><br>In fact, because the aeolipile depended only upon the expansive force of steam, it should probably be remembered as the first in a line of engineering dead ends. But if the inspirational value of Heron's steam turbine was less than generally realized, that of his writings was incomparably greater. He wrote at least seven complete books, including Metrika, collecting his innovations in geometry, and Automata, which described a number of self-regulating machines, including an ingenious mechanical door opener. Most significant of all was Pneumatika, less for its descriptions of the inventions of this remarkable man (in addition to the aeolipile, the book included "Temple Doors Opened by Fire on an Altar," "A Fountain Which Trickles by the Action of the Sun's Rays," and "A Trumpet, in the Hands of an Automaton, Sounded by Compressed Air," a catalog that reinforces the picture of Heron as antiquity's best toymaker) than for a single insight: that the phenomenon observed when sucking the air out of a chamber is nothing more than the pressure of the air around that chamber. It was a revelation that turned out to be utterly critical in the creation of the world's first steam engines, and therefore of the Industrial Revolution that those engines powered.<br><br>The idea wasn't, of course, completely original to Heron; the idea that air is a source of energy is immeasurably older than science, or even technology. Ctesibos, an inventor and engineer born in Alexandria three centuries before Heron, supposedly used compressed air to operate his "water organ" that used water as a piston to force air through different tubes, making music.<br><br>Just as the ancients realized that moving air exerts pressure, they also recognized that its absence did something similar. The realization that sucking air out of a closed chamber creates a vacuum seems fairly obvious to any child who has ever placed a finger on top of a straw-as indeed it was to Heron. In the preface to Pneumatika, he wrote, if a light vessel with a narrow mouth be taken and applied to the lips, and the air be sucked out and discharged, the vessel will be suspended from the lips, the vacuum drawing the flesh towards it that the exhausted space may he filled. It is manifest from this that there was a continuous vacuum in the vessel...thus producing what a modern scholar has called a "very satisfactory theory of elastic fluids."<br><br>Satisfactory to a twenty-first-century child, and a first-century mathematician, but not, unfortunately, for a whole lot of people in between. To them, the idea that space could exist absent any occupants, which seems self-evident, was evidently not, and the reason was the dead hand of the philosopher-scientist who tutored Alexandria's founder. Aristotle argued against the existence of a vacuum with unerring, though curiously inelegant, logic. His primary argument ran something like this:<br><br>1. If empty space can be measured, then it must have dimension.<br><br>2. If it has dimension, then it must be a body (this is something of a tautology: by Aristotelian definition, bodies are things that have dimension).<br><br>3. Therefore, anything moving into such a previously empty space would be occupying the same space simultaneously, and two bodies cannot do so.<br><br>More persuasive was the argument that a void is "unnecessary," that since the fundamental character of an object consists of those measurable dimensions, then a void with the same dimensions as the cup, or horse, or ship occupying it is no different from the object. One, therefore, is redundant, and since the object cannot be superfluous, the void must be.<br><br>It takes millennia to recover from that sort of unassailable logic, temptingly similar to that used in Monty Python and the Holy Grail to demonstrate that if a woman weighs as much as a duck, she is a witch. Aristotle's blind spot regarding the existence of a void would be inherited by a hundred generations of his adherents. Those who read the work of Heron did so through an Aristotelian scrim on which was printed, in metaphorical letters twenty feet high: NATURE ABHORS A VACUUM.<br><br>Given that, it is something of a small miracle that Pneumatika, and its description of vacuum, survived at all. But survive it did, like so many of the great works of antiquity, in an Arabic translation, until around the thirteenth century, when it first appeared in Latin. And it was another three hundred years until a really influential translation arrived, an Italian edition translated by Giovanni Batista Aleotti d'Argenta and published in 1589. Aleotti's work, and subsequent translations of his translation into German, English, and French (plus five more in Italian alone), demonstrate both the demand for and availability of the book. Aleotti, an architect and engineer, was practical enough; in his annotations to his translation of the Pneumatika, he mentions the difficulty of removing a ramrod from a cannon with its touchhole covered because of the pressure of air against the vacuum therefore created-a phenomenon that could only exist if air were compressible and vacuum possible. It is testimony to the weight of formal logic that even with the evidence in front of his nose, Aleotti was still intellectually unable to deny his Aristotle.<br><br>If Aleotti was unaware of the implications of Heron's observations, he was indefatigable in promoting them, and by the seventeenth century, it can, with a wink, be said that Pneumatika was very much in the air, in large part because of the Renaissance enthusiasm for duplicating natural phenomena by mechanical means, the era's reflexive admiration for the achievements of Greek antiquity. The scientist and philosopher Blaise Pascal (who modeled his calculator, the Pascaline, on an invention of Heron's) mentioned it in D'esprit g�ometrique, as did the Oxford scholar Robert Burton in his masterpiece, Anatomy of Melancholy: "What is so intricate, and pleasing as to peruse...Hero Alexandrinus' work on the air engine." But nowhere was Aleotti's translation more popular than the city-state of Firenze, or Florence.<br><br>Florence, in the year 1641, had been essentially the private fief of the Medici family for two centuries. The city, ground zero for both the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution, was also where Galileo Galilei had chosen to live out the sentence imposed by the Inquisition for his heretical writings that argued that the earth revolved around the sun. Galileo was seventy years old and living in a villa in Arcetri, in the hills above the city, when he read a book on the physics of movement titled De motu (sometimes Trattato del Moto) and summoned its author, Evangelista Torricelli, a mathematician then living in Rome. Torricelli, whose admiration for Galileo was practically without limit, decamped in time not only to spend the last three months of the great man's life at his side, but to succeed him as professor of mathematics at the Florentine Academy. There he would make a number of important contributions to both the calculus and fluid mechanics. In 1643, he discovered a core truth in the behavior of liquids in motion, known as Torricelli's theorem, that is still used to calculate the speed of a fluid when it exits the vessel that contains it. He made fundamental contributions to the development of the calculus, and to the geometry of the cycloid (the path described by a point on a rolling wheel). Less typically, he embarked on a series of investigations whose results were, literally, revolutionary.<br><br>In those investigations, Torricelli used a tool even more powerful than his well-cultivated talent for mathematical logic: He did experiments. At the behest of one of his patrons, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, whose engineers were unable to build a sufficiently powerful pump, Torricelli designed a series of apparatuses to test the limits of the action of contemporary water pumps. In spring of 1644, Torricelli filled a narrow, four-foot-long glass tube with mercury-a far heavier fluid than water-inverted it in a basin of mercury, sealing the tube's top, and documented that while the mercury did not pour out, it did leave a space at the closed top of the tube. He reasoned that since nothing could have slipped past the mercury in the tube, what occupied the top of the tube must, therefore, be nothing: a vacuum.<br><br>Even more brilliantly, Torricelli reasoned, and then demonstrated, that the amount of space at the top of the tube varied at different times of the day and month. The only explanation that accounted for his observations was that the variance was caused by the pressure of air; the more pressure on the open reservoir of mercury at the base of the tube, the higher the mercury rose within. Torricelli had not only invented, more or less accidentally, the first barometer; he had demonstrated the existence of air pressure, writing to his colleague Michelangelo Ricci, "I have already called attention to certain philosophical experiments that are in progress...relating to vacuum, designed not just to make a vacuum but to make an instrument which will exhibit changes in the atmosphere...we live submerged at the bottom of an ocean of air..."<br><br>Torricelli was not, even by the standards of his day, a terribly ambitious inventor. When faced with hostility from religious authorities and other traditionalists who believed, correctly, that his discovery was a direct shot at the Aristotelian world, he happily returned to his beloved cycloids, the latest traveler to find himself on the wrong side of the boundary line between science and technology.</p><h2>True Believer</h2><p><b>Part love story and part ghost story, this is an unforgettable <i>New York Times</i> bestseller about a science journalist and a North Carolina librarian who dare to believe in the impossible.</b><br><br>As a science journalist with a regular column in <i>Scientific American</i>, Jeremy Marsh specializes in debunking the supernatural-until he falls in love with the granddaughter of the town psychic.<br><br>When Jeremy receives a letter from Boone Creek, North Carolina, about ghostly lights appearing in a cemetery, he can't resist driving down to investigate.

This is a large format, square-ish hardback which is designed to be used -- it isn't a mammoth "coffee table" book that ends up hurting your hands after ten minutes. The quality of the reproduction here is very good indeed with almost all of the images being full-page. The classic Karsh silvery highlights and deep blacks are shown to advantage. BOOK DETAILS -- hardback bound in soft red cloth with silver details; 190 pp of glossy stock; dustjacket; 3.5 pounds; mostly b&amp;w with a few color images. ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPHY -- The term "iconic" gets tossed around a lot, but that is what this book consists of: iconic images. Whether you know it or not, Karsh is the photographyer who probably shaped your image of who Hemingway is, who Churchill is, who Einstein is, who Bogart is, and on, and on. The photographic school on display is classic, formal, and dramatic mid-century 20th century photography. It is quite grand in style while still revealing the human being behind the image. Karsh is a great craftsman who brings unabashed enthusiasm for the power of celebrity -- in these two ways, he has probably most influenced the history of photography.</p><p>An Armenian who immigrated to Canada as a child in 1924, Karsh is perhaps best-known for his portrait of an angered Winston Churchill, taken moments after the photographer plucked the prime minister's cigar from his mouth. That picture and 200 others are included here, and "even critics of Karsh's theatrical lighting style should be stirred by this dramatic cumulative portrait of a cultural lifetime," PW stated. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Valley of the Shadow (Sister Fidelma Mysteries)</h2><p>Seventh-century sleuth Sister Fidelma is charged with solving the gruesome pagan murders of 33 young men.</p><p>Peter Tremayne is the fiction pseudonym for Peter Berresford Ellis, the most prominent authority on the ancient Celts. As Tremayne, he is the author of sevenbooks featuring Sister Fidelma, including <i>Emlock at Vespers</i>and <i>The Spider's Web</i>. He lives in London.By her sixth outing, seventh-century sleuth Sister Fidelma (The Spider's Web, 1999, etc.) has withdrawn from her religious house to represent her brother, the King of Muman, and the bishop of Imleach when mountain chieftain Laisre invites negotiations for a Christian church in his Druidic stronghold. On the threshold of Laisre's remote valley she and her escort, Brother Eadulf, stumble across 33 ritually slain bodies. Strangely, Laisre prevents Fidelma, a credentialed Brehon investigator, from pursuing inquiries. At the same time, she learns that Laisre's advisers, powerful sister Orla and Druid leader Murgal, did not approve his invitation to Christianity and are hostile to his plan and to all outsiders. Then why is Brother Solin, secretary to the bishop of Imleach's northern rival, welcome in this hidden valley? No sooner do Fidelma and Eadulf realize the political significance of his presence than Solin is murdered and Fidelma accused. Can Roman Eadulf learn enough about Celtic law to exonerate Fidelma? Are the ritual slaughter and Solin's murder linked? Is there a traitor on the inside? Before Fidelma can part personal motives enmeshed in the political, she has to cut through a fabulous swirl of mysterious outsiders, secret meetings, disguised identities, and more deaths. When her acute observations and logical distinctions aren't enough, Fidelma's capacity for bluff saves the day and her country. Tremaynes discriminating sense of historydistinguishing ever-finer conflicts between Druids and Christians, Roman and Celtic Christians, northern and southern Celtscreates an equally complex mystery for history-mad readers with eyes as sharp as Fidelma's. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

By the time of its completion, the road would cover over 2,400 miles, three time zones, and eight states. It would link the windy shores of Lake Michigan with the waters of the Pacific Ocean-- a two-lane road rolling together through the great American Southwest, tying together the vestiges of America's pioneer passages into one meandering and magnificent highway.<br><br>Route 66. It was the road of dreamers and ramblers, drifters and writers: the road of John Steinbeck, Woody Guthrie, and Jack Kerouac. A ribbon of American highway that transported the Okies, driven from their land as storms of dust swept across their farms, to the promise of California. It was also the highway of commerce-- of automated ice-cream stands and old "no-tell" motels, salty truck stops, and a neon allure. Phillips 66, Coca-Cola, Burma Shave. It was Bobby Troup's "Get Your Kicks on Route 66." It was the lights and the breeze and the radio and the litany of towns: Joplin, Flagstaff, San Bernardino. A smilin', "Hi-how're-y'all-doin-t'night" big-boned waitress and a steamin' cup of coffee. Route 66, the passage west, the road of flight, the Mother Road.<br><br>After seventeen years of research, Michael Wallis has compiled <i>the</i> definitive book on the most legendary road in American history. Wallis weaves together a rich tapestry of eight decades that chronicles the road from its founding to its demise with the advent of the interstate system, and to its current unprecedented revival. <i>Route 66</i> is also a pictorial journey of nearly three hundred images that detail the highway's history, roadside diners, motels, forgotten towns, and most impressively, its people.<br><br>Two years after its nostalgia-inspiring hardcover publication, Michael Wallis's bestselling <i>Route 66</i> finally appears here in its first paperback edition. It is a book, unlike any in recent social history, that has spawned a national movement, brought new hope to those pockets of the American prairies where hope had long since vanished, and revived a dying American road.<br></p><p>Michael Wallis is the widely acclaimed author of <i>Pretty Boy</i> and the best-selling book<i> Oil Man</i>. He is currently collaborating with Chief Wilma Mankiller on a book about her life and the story of the Cherokee people. Born in the 66-town of St. Louis, Wallis now lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a short distance from the Mother Road.<br>"Like others before him, from John Steinbeck to Charles Kuralt, Michael Wallis went on the road in search of America. The result is...a colorful paean to a most romantic highway."--<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"Since the do-gooders abolished public hangings, the only show in town worth watching is the traffic on Highway 66 heading West and <i>Route 66: The Mother Road</i> is the best book we have to tell us what we are seeing."--Stanley Marsh III, Owner, Cadillac Ranch, Amarillo, Texas<br><br>"This story of our nation's most famous highway keeps alive an important part of American history.

Uncle John&#39;s letter said someone--no one knew who--was living in the old, dilapidated house on the edge of the Shaw property. When Mandie arrives home, she discovers that her only clue is a faint, flickering light sporadically shining from the ramshackle building. Late-night investigations make Mandie and her friends certain that someone is indeed hiding out, but who can it be? Why all the secrecy?</p><p>Lois began her first Mandie story when she was only eleven years old. But eventually the manuscript was tucked away in a drawer and forgotten. Lois went on to attend Furman University and studied music for several years in New York City where she and her sister sang professionally. Some years ago, Lois was prompted to pull that old manuscript out and began to work on Mandie&#39;s story-of her childhood in the South at the turn of the century and her Cherokee heritage. The rest is history and now the MANDIE BOOKS series have sales nearing six million copies! Lois writes from her home in South Carolina. Enthusiastic young fans fill her mailbox with their insightful responses to her stories.Unlike the Left Behind: The Kids volumes, the Mandie series is easy to jump into at any point. The 34th installment, set in 1903, finds the mystery-loving heroine leaving the Misses Heathwoods' School for Girls for spring vacation; little bits of the back story conveniently spliced into the beginning will quickly bring new readers up to speed. At the grand North Carolina mansion of her uncle/ adopted father, Mandie notices strange lights at a supposedly abandoned house. Fans of the series and with in-print figures at about 7 million, they are many shouldn't be too surprised when the mystery hinges on a runaway girl, a mistreated orphan, as Leppard's plots tend to favor theatrical elements. Religious messages are mostly subtextual, but what might deter readers (or presiding adults) is the language. The servants favor a Gone With the Wind dialect, as in "Aunt" Lou's "Lawsy mercy, this chile got to eat something right away, Doctuh.... We's gwine fix dat right now." Ages 8-12. (Sept.)

Furthermore, New Evangelicalism has sped headlong into un-Christian philosophies and standards that make even the founding fathers of the movement draw back.</p><p></p><h2>Pushkin Hills</h2><p>An unsuccessful writer and an inveterate alcoholic, Boris Alikhanov has recently divorced his wife Tatyana, and he is running out of money.

Melissa took our photograph outside, with Bobbi smoking and me self-consciously holding my left wrist in my right hand, as if I was afraid the wrist was going to get away from me. Melissa used a big professional camera and kept lots of different lenses in a special camera pouch. She chatted and smoked while taking the pictures. She talked about our performance and we talked about her work, which we&#x2019;d come across on the inter- net. Around midnight the bar closed. It was starting to rain then, and Melissa told us we were welcome to come back to her house for a drink.</p><p>We all got into the back of a taxi together and started fixing up our seat belts. Bobbi sat in the middle, with her head turned to speak to Melissa, so I could see the back of her neck and her little spoon-like ear. Melissa gave the driver an address in Monkstown and I turned to look out the window. A voice came on the radio to say the words: eighties . . . pop. . . classics. Then a jingle played. I felt excited, ready for the challenge of visiting a stranger&#x2019;s home, already preparing compliments and certain facial expressions to make myself seem charming.</p><p>The house was a semi-detached red-brick, with a sycamore tree outside. Under the streetlight the leaves looked orange and artificial. I was a big fan of seeing the insides of other people&#x2019;s houses, especially people who were slightly famous like Melissa. Right away I decided to remember everything about her home, so I could describe it to our other friends later and Bobbi could agree.</p><p>When Melissa let us in, a little red spaniel came racing up the hall and started barking at us. The hallway was warm and the lights were on. Next to the door was a low table where someone had left a stack of change, a hairbrush and an open tube of lipstick. There was a Modigliani print hanging over the staircase, a nude woman reclining. I thought: this is a whole house. A family could live here.</p><p>We have guests, Melissa called down the corridor.</p><p>No one appeared so we followed her into the kitchen. I remember seeing a dark wooden bowl filled with ripe fruit, and noticing the glass conservatory. Rich people, I thought. I was always thinking about rich people then. The dog had followed us to the kitchen and was snuffling around at our feet, but Melissa didn&#x2019;t mention the dog so neither did we.</p><p>Wine? Melissa said. White or red?</p><p>She poured huge, bowl-sized glasses and we all sat around a low table. Melissa asked us how we&#x2019;d started out performing spoken word poetry together. We had both just finished our third year of university at the time, but we&#x2019;d been per- forming together since we were in school. Exams were over by then. It was late May.</p><p>Melissa had her camera on the table and occasionally lifted it to take a photograph, laughing self-deprecatingly about being a &#x2018;work addict&#x2019;. She lit a cigarette and tipped the ash into a kitschy-looking glass ashtray. The house didn&#x2019;t smell of smoke at all and I wondered if she usually smoked in there or not.</p><p>I made some new friends, she said.</p><p>Her husband was in the kitchen doorway. He held up his hand to acknowledge us and the dog started yelping and whining and running around in circles.</p><p>This is Frances, said Melissa. And this is Bobbi. They&#x2019;re poets.</p><p>He took a bottle of beer out of the fridge and opened it on the countertop.</p><p>Come and sit with us, Melissa said.</p><p>Yeah, I&#x2019;d love to, he said, but I should try and get some sleep before this flight.</p><p>The dog jumped up on a kitchen chair near where he was standing and he reached out absently to touch its head. He asked Melissa if she had fed the dog, she said no. He lifted the dog into his arms and let the dog lick his neck and jaw. He said he would feed her, and he went back out the kitchen door again.</p><p>Nick&#x2019;s filming tomorrow morning in Cardiff, said Melissa. We already knew that the husband was an actor. He and Melissa were frequently photographed together at events, and we had friends of friends who had met them. He had a big, handsome face, and looked like he could comfortably pick Melissa up under one arm and fend off interlopers with the other.</p><p>He&#x2019;s very tall, Bobbi said.</p><p>Melissa smiled as if &#x2018;tall&#x2019; was a euphemism for some- thing, but not necessarily something flattering. The conversation moved on. We got into a short discussion about the government and the Catholic Church. Melissa asked us if we were religious and we said no. She said she found religious occasions, like funerals or weddings, &#x2018;comforting in a kind of sedative way&#x2019;. They&#x2019;re communal, she said. There&#x2019;s something nice about that for the neurotic individualist. And I went to a convent school so I still know most of the prayers.</p><p>We went to a convent school, said Bobbi. It posed issues. Melissa grinned and said: like what?</p><p>Well, I&#x2019;m gay, said Bobbi. And Frances is a communist.</p><p>I also don&#x2019;t think I remember any of the prayers, I said. We sat there talking and drinking for a long time. I</p><p>remember that we talked about the poet Patricia Lockwood, who we admired, and also about what Bobbi disparagingly called &#x2018;pay gap feminism&#x2019;. I started to get tired and a little drunk. I couldn&#x2019;t think of anything witty to say and it was hard to arrange my face in a way that would convey my sense of humour. I think I laughed and nodded a lot. Melissa told us she was working on a new book of essays. Bobbi had read her first one, but I hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not very good, Melissa told me. Wait till the next one comes out.</p><p>At about three o&#x2019;clock, she showed us to the spare room and told us how great it was to meet us and how glad she was that we were staying. When we got into bed I stared up at the ceiling and felt very drunk. The room was spinning repetitively in short, consecutive spins. Once I adjusted my eyes to one rotation, another would begin immediately. I asked Bobbi if she was also having a problem with that but she said no.</p><p>She&#x2019;s amazing, isn&#x2019;t she? said Bobbi. Melissa. I like her, I said.</p><p>We could hear her voice in the corridor, and her footsteps taking her from room to room. Once when the dog barked we could hear her yell something, and then her husband&#x2019;s voice. But after that we fell asleep. We didn&#x2019;t hear him leave.</p><p>/</p><p>Bobbi and I had first met in secondary school. Back then Bobbi was very opinionated, and frequently spent time in detention for a behavioural offence our school called &#x2018;disrupting teaching and learning&#x2019;. When we were sixteen she got her nose pierced and took up smoking. Nobody liked her. She got temporarily suspended once for writing &#x2018;fuck the patriarchy&#x2019; on the wall beside a plaster cast of the crucifixion. There was no feeling of solidarity around this incident. Bobbi was considered a show-off. Even I had to admit that teaching and learning went a lot more smoothly during the week she was gone.</p><p>When we were seventeen we had to attend a fundraising dance in the school assembly hall, with a partially broken disco ball casting lights on the ceiling and the barred-up windows. Bobbi wore a flimsy summer dress and looked like she hadn&#x2019;t brushed her hair. She was radiantly attractive, which meant everyone had to work hard not to pay her any attention. I told her I liked her dress. She gave me some of the vodka she was drinking from a Coke bottle and asked if the rest of the school was locked up. We checked the door up to the back staircase and found it was open. All the</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>lights were off and no one else was up there. We could hear the music buzzing through the floorboards, like a ringtone belonging to someone else. Bobbi gave me some more of her vodka and asked me if I liked girls. It was very easy to act unfazed around her. I just said: sure.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t betraying anyone&#x2019;s loyalties by being Bobbi&#x2019;s girlfriend. I didn&#x2019;t have close friends and at lunchtime I read textbooks alone in the school library. I liked the other girls, I let them copy my homework, but I was lonely and felt unworthy of real friendship. I made lists of the things I had to improve about myself. After Bobbi and I started seeing each other, everything changed. No one asked for my home- work anymore. At lunchtime we walked along the car park holding hands and people looked away from us maliciously. It was fun, the first real fun I&#x2019;d ever had.</p><p>After school we used to lie in her room listening to music and talking about why we liked each other. These were long and intense conversations, and felt so momentous to me that I secretly transcribed parts of them from memory in the evenings. When Bobbi talked about me it felt like seeing myself in a mirror for the first time. I also looked in actual mirrors more often. I started taking a close interest in my face and body, which I&#x2019;d never done before. I asked Bobbi questions like: do I have long legs? Or short?</p><p>At our school graduation ceremony we performed a spoken word piece together. Some of the parents cried, but our classmates just looked out the assembly-room windows or talked quietly amongst themselves. Several months later, after more than a year together, Bobbi and I broke up.</p><p>/</p><p>Melissa wanted to write a profile about us. She sent us an email asking if we were interested, and attached some of the photographs she had taken outside the bar. Alone in my room, I downloaded one of the files and opened it up to full- screen. Bobbi looked back at me, mischievous, holding a cigarette in her right hand and pulling on her fur stole with the other. Beside her, I looked bored and interesting. I tried to imagine my name appearing in a profile piece, in a serif font with thick stems. I decided I would try harder to impress Melissa next time we met.</p><p>Bobbi called me almost immediately after the email arrived. Have you seen the photographs? she said. I think I&#x2019;m in</p><p>love with her.</p><p>I held my phone in one hand and zoomed in on Bobbi&#x2019;s face with the other. It was a high-quality image but I zoomed until I could see the pixellation.</p><p>Maybe you&#x2019;re just in love with your own face, I said.</p><p>Just because I have a beautiful face doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m a narcissist.</p><p>I let that one go. I was involved in the zooming process still. I knew that Melissa wrote for several big literary web- sites, and her work circulated widely online. She had written a famous essay about the Oscars which everyone reposted every year during awards season. Sometimes she also wrote local profiles, about artists who sold their work on Grafton Street or buskers in London; these were always accompanied by beautiful photographs of her subjects, looking human and full of &#x2018;character&#x2019;. I zoomed back out and tried to look at my own face as if I were a stranger on the internet seeing it for the first time. It looked round and white, the eyebrows like overturned parentheses, my eyes averted from the lens, almost shut. Even I could see I had character.</p><p>We emailed her back saying we&#x2019;d be delighted, and she invited us over for dinner to talk about our work and get some additional photographs. Bobbi and I discussed at length what Bobbi would wear to this event, under the guise of talking about what we should both wear. I lay in my room watching her look at herself in the mirror, moving pieces of her hair back and forth critically.</p><p>So when you say you&#x2019;re in love with Melissa, I said. I mean I have a crush on her.</p><p>You know she&#x2019;s married.</p><p>You don&#x2019;t think she likes me? said Bobbi.</p><p>She was holding up one of my white brushed-cotton shirts in front of the mirror.</p><p>What do you mean likes you? I said. Are we being serious or just joking?</p><p>I am partly being serious. I think she does like me. In an extramarital affair kind of way?</p><p>Bobbi just laughed at that. With other people I generally had a sense of what to take seriously and what not to, but with Bobbi it was impossible. She never seemed to be either fully serious or fully joking. As a result I had learned to adopt a kind of Zen acceptance of the weird things she said. I watched her take her blouse off and pull on the white shirt. She rolled up the sleeves carefully.</p><p>Good? she said. Or terrible? Good. It looks good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>It rained all day before we went for dinner at Melissa&#x2019;s. I sat in bed in the morning writing poetry, hitting the return key whenever I wanted. Eventually I opened my blinds, read the news online and showered. My apartment had a door out into the courtyard of the building, which was lavish with greenery and featured a cherry blossom tree in the far corner. It was almost June now, but in April the blossoms were bright and silky like confetti. The couple next door had a little baby who cried sometimes at night. I liked living there.</p><p>Bobbi and I met in town that evening and got a bus to Monkstown. Finding our way back to the house felt like unwrapping something in a game of pass the parcel. I mentioned this to Bobbi on the way and she said: is it the prize, or just another layer of wrapping?</p><p>We&#x2019;ll catch up on that after dinner, I said.</p><p>When we rang the bell, Melissa answered the door with her camera slung over one shoulder. She thanked us for coming. She had an expressive, conspiratorial smile, which I thought she probably gave to all of her subjects, as if to say: you&#x2019;re no ordinary subject to me, you&#x2019;re a special favourite. I knew I would enviously practise this smile later in a mirror. The spaniel yapped in the kitchen doorway while we hung up our jackets.</p><p>In the kitchen her husband was chopping vegetables. The dog was really excited by this gathering. It leapt onto a kitchen chair and barked for ten or twenty seconds before he told it to stop.</p><p>Can we get you both a glass of wine? Melissa said.</p><p>We said sure, and Nick poured the glasses. I had looked him up online since the first time we met him, partly because I didn&#x2019;t know any other actors in real life. He had mainly worked in theatre, but also did some TV and film. He had once, several years previously, been nominated for a major award, which he didn&#x2019;t win. I&#x2019;d happened on a whole selection of shirtless photographs, most of which showed him looking younger, coming out of a swimming pool or showering on a TV show that had long ago been cancelled. I sent Bobbi a link to one of these photographs with the message: trophy husband.</p><p>Melissa didn&#x2019;t appear in many photographs on the inter- net, though her collection of essays had generated a lot of publicity. I didn&#x2019;t know how long she had been married to Nick. Neither of them was famous enough for that kind of information to be online.</p><p>So you guys write everything together? Melissa said.</p><p>Oh God, no, said Bobbi. Frances writes everything. I don&#x2019;t even help.</p><p>That&#x2019;s not true, I said. That&#x2019;s not true, you do help. She&#x2019;s just saying that.</p><p>Melissa cocked her head to the side and gave a kind of laugh.</p><p>Alright, so, which one of you is lying? she said.</p><p>I was lying. Except in the sense of enriching my life, Bob- bi didn&#x2019;t help me write the poetry. As far as I knew she had never written creatively at all. She liked to perform dramatic monologues and sing anti-war ballads.

The decline of this group, a demographic of our country that has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, has been reported on with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside.</p><p><p>From a former marine and Yale Law School graduate, a probing look at the struggles of America&#x2019;s white working class through the author&#x2019;s own story of growing up in a poor Rust Belt town.</p><p><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis&#x2014;that of poor, white Americans. The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for over forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. In <em>HillbillyElegy</em>, J.D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hanging around your neck.</p><p>The Vance family story began with hope in postwar America. J.D.&#x2019;s grandparents were &#x201c;dirt poor and in love&#x201d; and moved north from Kentucky&#x2019;s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of <em>Hillbilly Elegy </em>plays out, we learn that J.D.&#x2019;s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.</p><p>A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, <em>Hillbilly Elegy </em>is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.</p><b>J. D. Vance</b> is a former Marine and a graduate of Yale Law School.

The characters in these tales, from the loyal little mermaid to the brave tin soldier to the ugly duckling, learn life lessons from the experiences they encounter, lessons that are still vital to the way we live today. And Gennady Spirins delicate watercolors, in the tradition of the great masters of the Renaissance, bring these enchanted characters and their valuable lessons magically to life. Together, the pictures and tales combine to create a timeless collection of classic stories that deserve a special place on every bookshelf. <p>Stories included: <br>The Princess and the Pea <br>The Brave Tin Soldier <br>Thumbelina <br>The Ugly Duckling <br>The Nightingale <br>The Little Mermaid</p></p><p>Spirin Gennady has won numerous illustration awards including the New York Time Best Illustrated Books of the he lives in New Jersey.Gr 3-6-This handsome picture-book-sized collection presents: "The Ugly Ducking," "Thumbelina," "The Steadfast Tin Soldier," "The Nightingale," "The Princess and the Pea," and "The Little Mermaid." A foreword introduces the Danish storyteller, noting that the text is "drawn from some of the earliest translations of his work." While wording may differ slightly from Erik Christian Haugaard's definitive translation, Hans Christian Andersen: The Complete Fairy Tales and Stories (Anchor, 1983), the stories here are complete and true to the originals. Spirin has illustrated them with lavishly detailed paintings that evoke Northern Renaissance art in both technique and content. His art is far more lush and painterly than Erik Blegvad's informal pen-and-ink drawings for his translation of Andersen's Twelve Tales (McElderry, 1994; o.p.), uniformly set in late 18th-century Europe. Libraries already owning Blegvad's translation will find this new title a fine complement. Only two stories overlap, and Spirin's sumptuous interpretation of "The Little Mermaid" (not included in Blegvad's collection) is well worth contrasting with the Disney version. Both collections, with accurate translations and illustrations that illuminate the classic stories in different ways, should be widely available.<p></p><p><i>Margaret A.

He was an artist and award-winning filmmaker. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> Odysseus ordered his men to plug their ears when they sailed by the island of the Sirens so they would not be lured to their destruction on the offshore rocks by the sea nymphs' irresistible song. In order to hear the song, Odysseus asked his men to lash him to the mast. I know all about this sort of thing because I hear a song like that of the Sirens every spring when the ice on the rivers begins to break up. Years ago in the heart of Winnipeg, Manitoba, I would be working at my desk in a commercial art studio, hear the song, hand in my two weeks' notice and get my outfit ready. My parents thought I would outgrow it but I never did. If anything, the song is becoming louder and more insistent with the passing years. </p><p> Some people hear the song in the quiet mist of a cold morning; others hear it in the middle of a roaring rapids. Sometimes the excitement drowns out the song. The thrills become all that matter as we seek one rapid after another. Sleeping, eating and living outdoors become something we do between rapids. But for other people the song is loudest in the evening when they are sifting in front of the tent, basking in the camp fire's warmth. This is when I hear it loudest, after I have paddled and portaged for many miles to some distant, hidden place. </p><p> I probably heard the song for the first time as a child playing among the canoes pulled up on the sand at Grand Beach on Lake Winnipeg. My parents tell me that they couldn't get me away from the canoes. I climbed over and in them by the hour. They couldn't have known it but, in my imagination, I was journeying to faroff places where only a canoe could go. </p><p> When I was about nine years old, a huge storm broke up the pier at Grand Beach. Everyone thought it was a great disaster, but I knew it for what it really was: a miracle. All my life, as short as it then was, I had been trying to build a canoe by nailing driftwood together. Every time I grabbed my homemade paddle and climbed on board, it sank. I could never find enough wood to make a raft that would float with me on board. And now, as far along the beach as the eye could see, there was wood. </p><p> With considerable effort, I nailed together two timbers and set them afloat. A feeling of euphoria came over me as I hopped on and felt myself buoyed up by the water. Paddling away from the beach, I watched fascinated as the ripples in the sand dropped away beneath me. The water gradually darkened until I could no longer see the bottom. I was afloat on water that was deeper than I was tall. I loved the feeling of danger, excitement and adventure. For the first time in my life, I was no longer bound to the land; now I could reach the offshore rocks that had seemed so far away. </p><p> Mine was the most beautiful canoe ever made because it was mine. I hated it when people called it a raft, so I hacked away at the ends with my penknife to create some semblance of a bow. I would paddle over to what was left of the pier and tie my canoe to the ladder along with the other canoes. Tying and untying the knot was a wonderful ritual. It was a way of affirming ownership: this was my canoe, and I could paddle it anywhere, anytime I wanted. Just belonging to a canoe is a large part of being a canoeist. </p><p> After my journeys, I would sometimes hang around the boat livery at Grand Beach. The owner had a great fleet of canoes and rowboats, and sometimes I would see this kid bailing the rainwater out of them. I figured he must be very rich to own so many canoes. Occasionally my father would rent one for what seemed like the world's shortest hour. I loved being in a real canoe, and yet it wasn't quite the same as paddling my timber canoe alone. Even though Dad let me decide where to go, he did the steering. Already I had fallen in love with solo paddling. </p><p> The first thing I ever owned, that was related to a real canoe, was a paddle. On one of our excursions, Dad and I found a paddle floating in the weeds. It had probably belonged to two canoeists who had tipped and drowned in the lagoon a couple of weeks before. I also suspected that their canoe had been rented from the boat livery. My father threw the paddle up on shore. After returning the canoe, we went back to retrieve it. Although I knew at some level that the paddle was tainted, my conscience was clear. Dad did it, not me. Anyway, even if it did belong to the rich kid at the livery, I figured he would never miss it. That paddle became my most cherished possession. </p><p> Many years later, I learned that your sins always find you out. Barrie Nelson, a good friend with whom I had worked in an animation studio, and canoed with on many enjoyable trips, picked an old paddle out of my paddle rack. He studied it for a long time, then turned to me and asked, "Where did you get this paddle?" I explained how we had found it in the lagoon at Grand Beach. A smile crossed his face as he looked at me and said, "You crooks! This paddle belonged to my grandmother's boat livery. I used to spend the summers there looking after the canoes." I could hardly believe it. My best friend had spent his childhood wallowing in a canoe mecca and had never invited me to go for a ride! I'd have sold my grandmother just for the privilege of sitting in those canoes, let alone paddling them. </p><p> Many people have asked me, "What came first? Your love for the canoe or the land?" It definitely the canoe. The canoe took me away from the crowds and introduced me to places that had remained unchanged for centuries. And in the going I discovered a sense of freedom that has never been equaled in any other way. When I was 11 years old, I began work on what would be my first real canoe. Of course I had no idea how to build a real canoe, so it was built with a kayak construction using formers and stringers. It took a full winter to complete the job. In the spring, we hauled it down to the Red River that flows through Winnipeg and, much to the surprise of my parents, it actually floated upright. I grabbed my ill-gotten, oversized paddle and headed off. I was elated with my new-found freedom. I was no longer just listening to the song. I was singing it! </p></p><h2>Painting Sunlight and Shadow with Pastels: Essential Techniques for Brilliant Effects</h2><p><p><b>Infuse your paintings with light and life!</b></p><p>Whether you work outdoors or indoors, understanding the effects of light and shadow is key to making your art lifelike and engaging.

"Stunning."--<i>School Library Journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p>Eyewitness Books' <i>Ancient Egypt</i> continues the tradition of excellent, accurate, and beautiful reference works for kids 9 to 12 years old. Ancient Egyptian civilization holds a special fascination for many, with its mummies, pyramids, and highly stylized artworks. Kids can explore a Pharaoh's tomb, see a mummy up close, and find out about Egyptian gods. Lots of archaeological relics show what life was like for the ancient Egyptians, from how they dressed to the games they played.Grade 5-8 Like the successful "Eyewitness" books, this series has a large format, captionlike texts, and an extravagant museum of illustrations. Large fold-out pages illustrate big ideas, e.g., the burial procession of a pharaoh. Each book tackles a broad subject, but glossaries, indexes, time lines, and maps help unify the information. Small boxes scattered throughout are obviously meant to capture readers' attention, but they sometimes backfire, as when the facts they provide are too mundane or obscure for the intended audience. Ancient Egypt makes a broad sweep of the history of the land of the Nile, hitting on the standard topics, but also focusing on the daily life of ancient Egyptians.

In doing so, it reminds us that what we choose to eat can either conserve or deplete the cornucopia of our continent.<br><br>While offering a eulogy to a once-common game food that has gone extinct--the passenger pigeon--the book doesn't dwell on tragic losses. Instead, it highlights the success stories of food recovery, habitat restoration, and market revitalization that chefs, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and foresters have recently achieved. Through such "food parables," editor Gary Paul Nabhan and his colleagues build a persuasive argument for eater-based conservation.<br><br>In addition, this book offers the first-ever list of foods at risk in America (more than a thousand), shows how all of us can personally support and participate in such recoveries, and lists food festivals held across the continent to honor and enjoy some of the country's most iconic foods, from crab cakes to maple syrup and fil� gumbo.

With that cry of medieval knights a new era in European history began. Across Europe a wave of pious enthusiasm led many thousands to leave their homes, family, and friends to march to a distant land in a great struggle for Christ. Yet the crusades were more than simply a holy war. They represent a synthesis of attitudes and values that were uniquely medieval&#x2014;so medieval, in fact, that the crusading movement is rarely understood today. This book places the crusades within the medieval social, economic, religious, and intellectual environments that gave birth to the movement and nurtured it for centuries. The events of the crusades to Palestine and Europe's periphery are narrated in a clear, concise, and compelling manner. Special attention is also given to the crusades' effects on the Islamic world and the Christian Byzantine East. Also included is a historiographical overview of the subject as well as an up-to-date select biography.</p><p>Thomas F. Madden is associate professor of history at Saint Louis University and the co-author of The Fourth Crusade: The Conquest of Constantinople.In little more than 200 pages, in crystal-clear and economical prose, Madden does a superb job of exposition. As an introduction to the vast literature of the crusades, this is a jewel of a book. It has all one needs to understand the epic nature of the various mobilizations and invasions, who the important players were and how they operated, and why what was for centuries romanticized as chivalrous has today become odious. (James Reston Jr. <i>Washington Post Book World</i>)<br><br>Much praise is due to the author for giving us such a clear, concise picture of an ever-changing area of scholarship. (Patrick J. Holt <i>H-Net Reviews</i>)<br><br>Professor Madden has written a strong narrative of the crusades, focusing on the crusades to the East and on the major (or numbered) crusades. (James Powell)<br><br>Readers will be pleased that Thomas Madden has hit just the right note in his sweeping but concise account of the crusades. While he follows the development of crusading down to the period of the Protestant Reformation, and offers, in an afterword, speculations about the modern impact of the medieval crusade, he never fails to interest and inform. His prose is lucid. And to give the graphic point, he offers the reader fourteen clearly produced maps depicting the Mediterranean world about A.D. 1000, the routes of the main crusades, and the crusade plan of Maximilian I in 1518. The usefulness of these is reinforced by an index, a glossary, mainly of Islamic terms, a list of translated sources, and a select bibliography. (<i>The Catholic Historical Review</i>)<br><br>A gripping narrative approach of the medieval social, economic, religious, and intellectual environments that gave birth to the Crusades and nurtured them for centuries. (<i>Missiology: An International Review</i>)<br><br>This is a wonderful piece of work that will greatly add to the sum of crusade historiography. . . . It is brilliantly executed. . . . Madden's ability as a writer of gripping narrative shines through. This is a work that students will love, largely because it does not read like a textbook. (Alfred Andrea)<br><br>Readers will owe Thomas Madden warm thanks for so clear an introductory account of so complex a phenomenon as a crusade. (<i>The Historian</i>)<br><br>A brilliant text and handbook for students, teachers and all readers taking interest in the history of the Crusades. (<i>Byzantische Zeitschrift</i>)<br><br>It is clear handling of a complex subject that lets the facts speak for themselves. The book, moreover, lives up to its title. It is concise, but not overly simplified. It would serve as a fine text for undergraduate history students. (<i>New Oxford Review</i>)<br><br>Lucid, interesting, and lively. It certainly deserves to be listed in the bibliography for all undergraduate and school courses on the Crusades.

A classic gothic romance, the story features an 18-year-old Miranda Wells who falls under the spell of a mysterious old mansion and its equally fascinating master. Tired of churning butter, weeding the garden patch, and receiving the dull young farmers who seek her hand in marriage, Miranda is excited by an invitation from the upstate New York estate of her distant relative, the intriguing Nicholas Van Ryn. Her passion is kindled by the icy fire of Nicholas, the last of the Van Ryns, and the luxury of Dragonwyck, and a way of life of which she has only dreamed. Dressed in satin and lace, she becomes part of Dragonwyck, with its Gothic towers, flowering gardens, acres of tenant farms, and dark, terrible secrets. This compelling novel paints a marvelous portrait of a country torn between freedom and feudal traditions; a country divided between the very wealthy and the very poor. Poor tenant farmers at Dragonwyck, the European royalty who visit, and American icons such as Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, and the Astors are vividly brought to life. This is a heart-stopping story of a remarkable woman, her breathtaking passions, and the mystery and terror that await her in the magnificent hallways of Dragonwyck.<br></p><p><b>&#x201c;There was, on the Hudson, a way of life such as this, and there was a house not unlike Dragonwyck.&#x201d;</b><br><br>In the spring of 1844 the Wells family receives a letter from a distant relative, the wealthy landowner Nicholas Van Ryn.

"Ruth Krauss's intuitive ability as a writer to capture the free-spirited thought processes and laughter of young children ensures her books' widespread acceptance and timeless appeal." So concludes her entry in children's <em>Books and Their Creators</em> (1995).</p>Now in its second season, HarperCollins's reissue of 22 Sendak classics continues. This time, his collaborations with Ruth Krauss take center stage. In Charlotte and the White Horse, first published in 1955, creamy pages frame Sendak's softly lit illustrations of a girl who convinces her father to keep a wobbly legged horse and cares for him until he can stand on his own. Sendak's delicate watercolors suit the dream-like mood of a boy who accomplishes all that he sets out to do in his imaginary world, in I Want to Paint My Bathroom Blue (1956), also by Krauss. A boy's imagination also comes to the fore in A Very Special House (1953) by Krauss, as the artist depicts the hero creating a home filled with a turtle, a giant, a very old lion and "some monkeys and some skunkeys." Oversize pages brim with the creatures as well as his house's "very special" furnishings. Open House for Butterflies (1960) takes a similar format to these collaborators' classic A Hole Is to Dig, and lastly, Hector Protector and As I Went Over the Water: Two Nursery Rhymes (1965) by Sendak conveys as much plot through the artist's wordless spreads as with the minimal text.

From the eighties through today, from Rio to All You Need is Now, John writes about the music, the parties, and the MTV videos that made millions swoon. With Duran Duran, John Taylor has created some of the greatest music of our time. From the disco dazzle of debut single &#x2018;Planet Earth&#x2019; right up to their latest number one album, All You Need is Now, Duran Duran has always had the power to sweep the world onto its feet. It&#x2019;s been a ride &#x2013; and for John in particular, the ride has been wild, thrilling... and dangerous. Now, for the first time, he tells his incredible story. A tale of dreams fulfilled, lessons learned and demons conquered. A shy only child, Nigel John Taylor wasn&#x2019;t an obvious candidate for pop stardom and frenzied girl panic. But when he ditched his first name and picked up a bass guitar, everything changed. John</p><p>JOHN TAYLOR is the bassist and cofounder with Nick Rhodes of the British rock band Duran Duran, with a career spanning three decades. In 1999 John married Gela Nash, cofounder of Juicy Couture.<b>INTRODUCTION </b><br><br>Today, I am comfortable to admit that I was a little unnerved when John Taylor formed a band before I had left school. You see, we met when I was ten years old and he was twelve&#x2014;both only children, liv�ing in the Hollywood hood, we swiftly adopted each other as brothers, so I always imagined we would do this together. Fortunately for me, his first group, Shock Treatment, didn&#x2019;t last for more than a season. The Assassins followed briefly, and then Dada, despite such a gloriously pretentious name, were rapidly destined for obscurity in the post-punk Birmingham music scene. I remain personally grateful for John&#x2019;s early setbacks.<br><br>In 1978, through immaculate correction, everything fell into place: we reverted to our original plan and set off on a mission to realize our childhood dreams. Fueled by the power of unbridled na�vet� and ambition, we formed Duran Duran version 1.0. From this time onward, we were aboard a one-way, nonstop roller coaster, which traveled exceedingly fast.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t often reflect upon the past because we are always too busy trying to invent our future, but it does seem strange, if I look over my shoulder for a moment, that somehow we went from being a couple of kids who loved music and went to endless concerts together, to creating a band that has shaped our lives in entirely unforeseen ways.<br><br>You must all be wondering what will be revealed in the pages ahead. I certainly know that John has a plentiful supply of captivating tales to tell . . .<br><br>I admire John&#x2019;s determination and tenacity. When we played our first show, he designed and printed the posters. We couldn&#x2019;t afford fancy lighting, so we projected his school geography field-trip slides over the stage. We have always tried to find a way to make things work. Practicality has served us well. Little has changed; I know today that if John and I have a vision, we can rely upon each other to make it happen.<br><br>I could tell you a lot of secrets about John: I was there to witness his first girlfriend, his first concert, and the first time he picked up a bass guitar. We figured it all out together&#x2014;we made music, made mistakes, made some friends and lost a few, too, learning to deflect scandals in newspapers when they sold their stories; but we always found our way. You will see what John chooses to unravel from the exquisitely frivolous to the profound. Perhaps he&#x2019;ll mention the time when he had just acquired the second of his three Aston Martins, and invited me out for a quick spin around London. Being a nondriver and easily susceptible to luxury, I willingly accepted the invitation. He picked me up and we glided smoothly into the late afternoon; but our trip soon came to an abrupt standstill, directly in front of Harrods, when the car broke down during rush hour. John looked at me and calmly announced, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s stalled for some reason, we&#x2019;ll have to get out and push . . .&#x201d; This wasn&#x2019;t ex�actly what I had in mind, but, needless to say, there were no other options readily available. A line of cars was building up behind us, and exasperated drivers were sounding their horns, which of course focused more attention on John and me, as we sheepishly climbed out of the car, trying not to look conspicuous with our newfound fame and brightly colored hair. Soon a small crowd had gathered, and startled onlookers began to ask for autographs, as we tried to maneuver the car out of traffic. We were shaken but not stirred. Maybe John has forgotten this incident, or more likely chosen to omit it, because there are many more significant episodes for him to recollect. It particularly resonated for me at the time, however, because in that snapshot I recognized just how much our lives had changed over twenty-four months.<br><br>Although we have both been on the same trajectory with Duran Duran for more than three decades, it is the choices we have faced and decisions we made in our personal lives that set the course for our individual pathways. It would be hard to find five people in the same band who have lived such di�verse lifestyles in parallel. I have seen John at the top of the mountain. We had number one records, sold-out tours, and performed to audiences who screamed so loud we couldn&#x2019;t hear what we were playing. He got the cars, he got the girls, and always received sackfuls more fan mail than anyone else in the band. Each of us reacted and adapted differently to our circumstances. John burned very bright, and then spiraled out of control in a spectacular fashion. It is no secret that he has struggled with addiction. We first noticed signs early on, but never grasped that things were getting serious. We all lived in a bubble of chaos, moving from limo to plane to hotel room to venue, then back to the hotel. So when someone didn&#x2019;t go to bed all night, or surface until the following evening, it was not particularly unusual. Somehow we managed to keep functioning as a band. It never occurred to me how close to the edge John had gone, until the late nineties, when he announced to us that he needed to take action to confront his problems. Simon and I were shocked. We had no idea that he was still haunted by drugs and alcohol, because al�though John can be an open book, he also has the capacity to be private and guarded.<br><br>In 1996, as a consequence of John&#x2019;s decision to change his life, he and I had a difficult phone call, during which he told me that he was leaving the band. I was numb, and although I had been feeling his presence slowly waning, with increasingly extended trips to LA, for me, it did not seem like the right time to give in. His mind was made up. He wanted to go, which left us with no remain�ing Taylors&#x2014;an unthinkable predicament for Duran Duran! In the aftermath, I wrote a lyric for a song called &#x201c;Buried in the Sand&#x201d; about our conversation, but it didn&#x2019;t change the fact that things now felt completely different. John left a gaping hole in the personality and sound of the band; we lost our focus and a crucial part of our identity. Simon and I missed him terribly.<br><br>After this, John and I continued to drift further apart. We had precious little contact for a couple of years, which seemed so alien, having spent virtu�ally every day together since our childhood. Then, a few scenes later, like most Hollywood productions, just when you think it&#x2019;s all over, something dramatic happens to save the universe: the Reunion. John came striding back into town, triumphantly flanked by the other missing Taylors. I will leave him to paint the scene, but suffice to say, our time apart made us better appreciate the chemistry we have together. John can be fragile and sensitive, yet equally strong and determined. He turned around his addictions and now concen�trates his energy on helping others with similar issues. John is the real deal. I have known him longer than any of my other friends. There is no one I would have rather shared this journey with. He&#x2019;s also my favorite bass player.<br><br>Finally, I should confess that I have not yet read this book, only resisting the temptation thus far, because I, too, hope one day to deliver my version of the events we encountered along the way, and I don&#x2019;t want to borrow what I don&#x2019;t remember.<br><br>I am inordinately curious to hear John&#x2019;s perspective, and to understand how he saw everything.

It&#x2019;s a week after my twenty-first birthday. The lights go down and &#x201c;Tel Aviv&#x201d; strikes up. We have chosen the haunt�ing, Middle Eastern&#x2013;inspired instrumental track from our new album to function as a curtain-raiser, to let the audience know the show is about to begin.<br><br>But something strange is happening. None of us can hear the music. What is going on out there? The sound of an audience. Getting louder. Larger. Chanting.<br><br>Screaming.<br><br>And then, out onto the stage, behind the safety curtain we go. A frisson of fear. We look to each other with nervous glances.

Here we go.<br><br>And the curtain rises on our new life.<br><br>The power of our instruments, amplified and magnified by PA stacks that reach to the roof, is no match for the overwhelming force of teenage sexual energy that comes surging at us in unstoppable waves from the audi�torium.<br><br>The power of it is palpable. I can feel it take control of my arms, my legs, my fingers, for the duration of the opening song. It is unrelenting, waves of it crashing onstage.<br><br>There is no way we can be heard, but that doesn&#x2019;t matter. No one is lis�tening to us anyway. They have come to hear themselves. To be heard. And what they have to say is this: &#x201c;Take me, ME! I am the one for you! John! Simon! Nick! Andy! Roger!&#x201d;<br><br>As our first song grinds to a hiccupping halt, we turn to each other for support. But the next song has already somehow begun without us. We are not in control anymore. Seats are smashed. Clothes torn. Stretcher cases. Breakdowns. It is a scene out of Bosch. Every female teenager in Britain is hav�ing her own teenage crisis, simultaneously as one, <i>right now</i>, vaguely in time to our music. The frenzy is contagious.

Ten o&#x2019;clock in the morning on any given weekday in 1964, and I have stepped down off the porch and wait, kicking at the grooved concrete drive�way, watching as Mom pulls the front door closed, locks it up, and puts the key in her handbag; she puts the handbag in the shopping bag, and off we go. Left off the drive and up the hill that is the street on which we live, Simon Road. Our house is number 34, one up from where the road ends.<br><br>We walk together along the pavement, counting down: 32, 30, 28. On the left side of the street are all the even-numbered semidetached houses, single buildings designed to function as two separate homes (ours is twinned with number 36). Across the street, the odd-numbered houses are detached, each building a single dwelling, all much larger than ours, and so are the back gar�dens, which are long and tree-filled and bordered at the bottom by a stream. The driveways are slicker too, with space for more than one car.<br><br>Later on, when I started to become a little status-aware, I would ask my parents, &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you pay the extra six hundred quid that would have got us a stream at the back?&#x201d;<br><br>I hold Mom&#x2019;s hand, remembering the Beatles song that is so often on the radio, as the incline gets steeper.

There&#x2019;s no complaining from me, it just is and ever shall be. Amen.<br><br>She&#x2019;s sweating now in her woolen skirt and raincoat, keen to get there. We walk past the Esso filling station where, in 1970, I will complete my set of commemorative soccer World Cup coins.

But being Anthony Bourdain, this was never going to be a conventional culinary tour. Bourdain heads out to Saigon where he eats the still-beating heart of a live cobra, and travels deep into landmined Khmer Rouge territory to find the rumoured Wild West of Cambodia (Pailin). Other stops include dining with gangsters in Russia, a medieval pig slaughter and feast in northern Portugal, the Basque All Male Gastronomique Society in Saint Sebastian, rural Mexico with his Mexican sous-chef, a pilgrimage to the French Laundry in the Napa Valley and a return to his roots in the tiny fishing village of La Teste, where he first ate an oyster as a child. Written with the inimitable machismo and humour that has made Tony Bourdain such a sensation, &#34;A Cook&#39;s Tour&#34; is an adventure story sure to give you indigestion.</p><p><i>A Cook's Tour</i> is the written record of Anthony Bourdain's travels around the world in his search for the perfect meal. All too conscious of the state of his 44-year-old knees after a working life standing at restaurant stoves, but with the unlooked-for jackpot of <i>Kitchen Confidential</i> as collateral, Mr. Bourdain evidently concluded he needed a bit more wind under his wings.<p>The idea of "perfect meal" in this context is to be taken to mean not necessarily the most upscale, chi-chi, three-star dining experience, but the ideal combination of food, atmosphere, and company. This would take in fishing villages in Vietnam, bars in Cambodia, and Tuareg camps in Morocco (roasted sheep's testicle, as it happens); it would stretch to smoked fish and sauna in the frozen Russian countryside and the French Laundry in California's Napa Valley. It would mean exquisitely refined <i>kaiseki</i> rituals in Japan after yakitori with drunken salarymen. Deep-fried Mars Bars in Glasgow and Gordon Ramsay in London. The still-beating heart of a cobra in Saigon. Drink. Danger. Guns. All with a TV crew in tow for the accompanying series--22 episodes of video gold, we are assured, featuring many don't-try-this-at-home shots of the author in gastric distress or crawling into yet another storm drain at four in the morning.</p><p>You are unlikely to lay your hands on a more hectically, strenuously entertaining book for some time. Our hero eats and swashbuckles round the globe with perfect-pitch attitude and liberal use of judiciously placed profanities. Bourdain can write. His timing is great. He is very funny and is under no illusions whatsoever about himself or anyone else. But most of all, he is a chef who got himself out of his kitchen and found, all over the world, people who understand that eating well is the foundation of harmonious living. <i>--Robin Davidson, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p>The only thing "gonzo gastronome" and internationally bestselling author Anthony Bourdain loves as much as cooking is traveling. Inspired by the question, "What would be the perfect meal?," Tony sets out on a quest for his culinary holy grail, and in the process turns the notion of "perfection" inside out. From California to Cambodia, <em>A Cooks' Tour</em> chronicles the unpredictable adventures of America's boldest and bravest chef.</p></p><h2>Dark Tower: the Gunslinger: The Way Station</h2><p>Roland's pursuit of the elusive Man in Black across the endless Mohaine desert becomes even more treacherous when he is attacked by a ravenous pack of desert dogs and vampiric dust devils when he is at his weakest!

Lalleman, Journal for the Study of the New Testament, 31.5, 2009)<br><br>"This new edition provides further interaction with the larger field of scholarship of the past twenty years. Designed for both the informed layperson and theological student/scholar, <em>Historical Reliability</em> sets forth arguments for the gospels as historically sound sources. For the general readership, the central argument is set forth in an engaging and accessible manner. For those more interested in particular issues covered by Blomberg, the footnotes provide access to the context of the discussion. Although not everyone will agree with his conclusions, Blomberg sets forth a compelling case worthy of consideration.

How can you tell if you have perfect pitch? Why do 10 violins sound only twice as loud as one? Do your Bob Dylan albums sound better on CD or vinyl? John Powell, a scientist and musician, answers these questions and many more in HOW MUSIC WORKS, an intriguing and original guide to acoustics. In a clear, accessible, and engaging voice, Powell fascinates the reader with his delightful descriptions of the science and psychology lurking beneath the surface of music. With lively discussions of the secrets behind harmony, timbre, keys, chords, loudness, musical composition, and more, HOW MUSIC WORKS will be treasured by music lovers everywhere.<b></b> The book also includes a CD of examples and exercises from the book.<br></p><p>John Powell holds a PhD in physics from Imperial College at London University. He has taught physics at the University of Nottingham and the University of Lulea in Sweden. In 2003, he earned a master&#39;s degree in music composition from the University of Sheffield in Great Britain.In this enlightening book, Powell, a British scholar and professor, sets out to explain how we experience music. He selects examples from all manner of disciplines--music composition, simple mathematics, physics, engineering, history--and offers his insights, such as how Bach' s Prelude in C Major is similar to Led Zeppelin' s Stairway to Heaven. In the first half, he defines the elements of music like pitch, frequency, harmony, rhythm, and decibel. Building on this foundation, Powell hits his stride in the book' s second half as he demonstrates, using both classical and pop music, how musicians create sound and how we listen to it. Some of the information can get scientific but Powell conveys the material with enough humor ( I think the decibel was invented in a bar, late one night, by a committee of drunken electrical engineers who wanted to take revenge on the world for their total lack of dancing partners ) and cocktail party facts ( when we listen to Mozart' s music nowadays, we are hearing it a semitone higher than he would have intended ) to keep the book light and fun. Included in the book is a 10-track CD. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But is Manfred sending them to the real future or one colored by his own dark and paranoid filter? As the time travelers are drawn into Manfred's dark worldview in both the future and present, the cost of doing business may drive them all insane.<p></p><p></p><p></p>PHILIP K.

A pioneer of modern acoustic blues, a fine songwriter and arranger, a powerful singer, and one of the most influential guitarists of the 1960s, he was also a marvelous storyteller, a peerless musical historian, and one of the most quotable figures on the Greenwich Village scene. Holding court in legendary venues like Gerde's Folk City and the Gaslight Caf8E, Van Ronk's influence was so great that a stretch of Sheridan Square&#x2014;the heart of the Village&#x2014;was renamed on June 30, 2004, and is now Dave Van Ronk Street. <i>The Mayor of MacDougal Street</i> is a unique first-hand account by a major player in the social and musical history of the '50s and '60s. It features encounters with young stars-to-be like Bob Dylan (who survived much of his first year in New York sleeping on Van Ronk's couch), Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs, Joan Baez, and Joni Mitchell, as well as older luminaries like Reverend Gary Davis, Woody Guthrie, Mississippi John Hurt, and Odetta.Colorful, hilarious, engaging, and a vivid evocation of a fascinating time and place, <i>The Mayor of MacDougal Street</i> will appeal not only to folk and blues fans but to anyone interested in the music, politics, and spirit of a revolutionary period in American culture.</p><p><b>Dave Van Ronk</b> (1936-2002) was one of the founding figures of the 1960s folk revival, but he was far more than that.

Ave Maria Mulligan is the town&#x2019;s self-proclaimed spinster, a thirty-five year old pharmacist with a &#x201c;mountain girl&#x2019;s body and a flat behind.&#x201d; She lives an amiable life with good friends and lots of hobbies until the fateful day in 1978 when she suddenly discovers that she&#x2019;s not who she always thought she was. Before she can blink, Ave&#x2019;s fielding marriage proposals, fighting off greedy family members, organizing a celebration for visiting celebrities, and planning the trip of a lifetime&#x2013;a trip that could change her view of the world and her own place in it forever. Brimming with humor and wise notions of small-town life, <i>Big Stone Gap</i> is a gem of a book with a giant heart. . . .</p><p>In the town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia, not much happens. The highlight of 35-year-old Ave Maria Mulligan's week comes on Friday, with the arrival of the Bookmobile, the sight of which sends her into raptures. Her favorite book concerns the ancient Chinese art of reading faces. Through her face-readings, we come to understand the hostilities simmering within her family: her father whose small eyes are the clear "sign of a deceptive nature." Her aunt who "has a small head and thin lips. (That's a terrible combination.)" Adriana Trigiani's first novel concerns the family scandals that befall Ave Maria in this seemingly uneventful town. Greed, lust, envy--all the ancient emotional elements--manifest themselves even in this hamlet of "ordinary folk." Fans of Fannie Flagg or Rebecca Wells will enjoy this down-home tale, full of small, everyday details and colloquial revelations. The writing is often awkward, but so too are the characters who inhabit this place: the Bookmobile lady who thinks of herself as the sexiest woman alive; the amateur actors in the local Outdoor Drama who bristle with ambition when they hear that Elizabeth Taylor is coming to visit. In Big Stone Gap, her visit is so anticipated, it's like she's an angel sent from heaven. <i>--Ellen Williams</i><br>"BIG STONE GAP is a southern novel that has the ring of truth, by which I mean<br>its characters are bizarre, its story is hilarious, and that it hooked me on<br>page one."<p><br>--John Berendt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Have there ever been more engaging late bloomers than Ave Maria Mulligan and her circle of doting, meddlesome friends? Adriana Trigiani writes with wit and grace about misguided romances and family secrets, and so very winningly about generous hearts.

The<br> digital age has changed so many things about the way writers<br> and publishers find each other and ferret out access to<br> sales and media outlets.

At the same time, its corporations and conglomerates trained a beady eye toward its newly opened markets, and a seemingly virgin economic landscape soon became home to icons such as Coke and McDonalds and Levi&#x2019;s. But the door was open wide, and tagging along with big business were some seedier characters: organized crime, a youth-and-glamour-obsessed oligarchy, and an entertainment complex hungry for the new concepts of its Western counterparts. That&#x2019;s where Peter Pomerantsev comes in. Born in Kiev but raised in Great Britain, Pomerantsev returned to Russia as a consultant to its burgeoning film and television&#x2014;especially &#x201c;reality&#x201d; television&#x2014;industries. What he found was a capitalist&#x2019;s wet dream: an unfettered cash and service economy with no apparent limits on cash or available services--one where <i>everything is possible</i>, if you can pay for it.

This outstanding collection brings together Orwell&#39;s longer, major essays and a fine selection of shorter pieces that includes &#39;My Country Right or Left&#39;, &#39;Decline of the English Murder&#39;, &#39;Shooting an Elephant&#39; and &#39;A Hanging&#39;. With great originality and wit Orwell unfolds his views on subjects ranging from a revaluation of Charles Dickens to the nature of Socialism, from a comic yet profound discussion of naughty seaside postcards to a spirited defence of English cooking. Displaying an almost unrivalled mastery of English plain prose, Orwell&#39;s essays created a unique literary manner from the process of thinking aloud and continue to challenge, move and entertain. This Penguin Modern Classics edition includes an introduction by Bernard Crick.</p><p>Eric Arthur Blair (1903-1950), better known by his pen-name, George Orwell, was born in India, where his father worked for the Civil Service. An author and journalist, Orwell was one of the most prominent and influential figures in twentieth-century literature. His unique political allegory Animal Farm was published in 1945, and it was this novel, together with the dystopia of Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), which brought him world-wide fame. His novels and non-fiction include Burmese Days, Down and Out in Paris and London, The Road to Wigan Pier and Homage to Catalonia.&#34;Orwell is the most influential political writer of the twentieth century...He gives us a gritty, personal example of how to engage as a writer in politics.&#34; -&#34;New York Review of Books &#34; &#34;[Orwell] evolved, in his seemingly offhand way, the clearest and most compelling English prose style this century...But of course he was more than just a great writer. We need him today because [of] his passion for the truth.&#34; -&#34;The Sunday Times &#34;(London) &#34;Had Orwell lived to a full term, he might well have gone on to become the greatest modern literary critic in the language. But he lived more than long enough to make writing about politics a branch of the humanities, setting a standard of civilized response to the intractably complex texture of life.&#34; -&#34;The New Yorker&#34; &#34;The real reason we read Orwell is because his own fault-line, his fundamental schism, his hybridity, left him exceptionally sensitive to the fissure-which is everywhere apparent-between what ought to be the casep</p><h2>Prince of Chaos</h2><p>On the brink of achieving the crown of Chaos, Merlin, aka Merle Corey, is challenged with silencing a murderous discord between Amber and Chaos and freeing a captive royal father who is under a villain&#39;s spell. Reprint.</p><p><p>Roger Zelazny&nbsp;burst onto the SF scene in the early 1960s with a series of dazzling and groundbreaking short stories. He won his first of six Hugo Awards for&nbsp;<em>Lord of Light</em>, and soon after produced the first book of his enormously popular&nbsp;<em>Amber</em>&nbsp;series,&nbsp;<em>Nine Princes in Amber.</em>&nbsp;In addition to his Hugos, he went on to win three Nebula Awards over the course of a long and distinguished career. He died on June 14, 1995.</p>Tenth book of the series that commenced in 1970 with Nine Princes in Amber and proceeded to Knight of Shadows (1989), wherein wizard Merle Corey remains central to the power struggle between the two opposing, sentient poles of magic, Amber's Pattern and the Courts of Chaos's Logrus. As the King of Chaos, Swayvill, finally dies, Merle is third in succession to the throne. By then the two who precede Merle die in mysterious circumstances, and it emerges that Merle's mother Dara and brother Mander are conspiring to ensorcell Merle and place him on the throne of Chaos as their puppet. Usefully, Merle makes friends with a number of former foes, then discovers that his long-lost father Corwin is still alive, as Dara's prisoner. Meanwhile, since the Pattern is slightly stronger than the Logrus, the Logrus kidnaps and conceals Coral, keeper of the powerful Jewel of Judgment. Glum, talky, and threadbare. Even more depressing, Zelanzy seems to be clearing the way for yet more additions to this already absurdly and pointlessly overextended series. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Not only did Steinbeck devote himself to his work with passion and discipline, but he also suffered from the deep anxiety and feelings of unworthiness that plague so many creative people. Sadly, his fears were all too often confirmed by an influential group of critics who savaged every book he published after the phenomenal success of The Grapes of Wrath in 1939. This critical scorn was diametrically opposed to Steinbeck's worldwide popularity, but Parini does suggest that Steinbeck would have benefited from a firmer editorial hand. At any rate, Steinbeck's struggles weren't confined to literature; he experienced plenty of conflict and pain on the familial and marital fronts as well. As Parini chronicles Steinbeck's youth, key friendships, marriages, travels, and the creation of each book, play, and film (Steinbeck loved writing scripts and making movies), he traces the evolution of Steinbeck's somewhat romantic and sentimental but unquestionably significant philosophy. In sum, Parini's finely wrought portrait of Steinbeck presents a quixotic, didactic, yet heroic figure fired with "moral outrage" and centered by a profound respect for nature and belief in the importance of stories. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Waning of the Middle Ages: A Study of the Forms of Life, Thought and Art in France and the Netherlands in the Dawn of the Renaissance (A Doubleday Anchor Book)</h2><p>Surveys the history of France and the Netherlands at the close of the Middle Ages, discussing the major factors dominating the social and cultural scene</p><p>In 1919, Johan Huizinga revealed in the original version of this book that the ideals, aspirations, and behaviors of humanity in history were dramatically different from those in present day. In Herfsttjj der Middeleeuwen, he recalled the waning years of the Middle Ages--the low countries in northern Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries--and argued against those who claimed that human belief systems remain the same even if contexts change. His account rested not on historical fact, but on the emotions and ambitions of the people as expressed through the art and literature of their culture. Many people treated the book as groundbreaking work, and it was translated into English in 1924.

Future readers will come to see this book as one of the central texts on wilderness and the interaction of nature and culture. The nine essays in The Practice of the Wild reveal why Snyder has gone on to become one of America&#x2019;s cultural leaders, comprehending things about our world before they were ever discussed in public. With thoughts ranging from political and spiritual matters to those regarding the environment and the art of becoming native to this continent, this collection of essays, first published in 1990, reflect the mature centerpiece of the author&#x2019;s work and thought.</p><p>Snyder writes as a missionary for the spiritual communions of our earth, but his cause is not well served by his own reading of it. From his very first words, Snyder conveys a sense of pedantry. He lectures carefully, speaking in jerky phrases with odd inflections and spaces his frequent lists as if to allow a student time for note-taking. He compounds this feeling by pronouncing foreign expressions, Native American or Oriental with a meticulous accent. Only when a section takes a narrative tone does his speech accelerate to a more conversational pace. This is a difficult type of literature to read without sounding like horatory. S.B.S. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineEssayist and Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Snyder ( Turtle Island ) offers nine sensitive and thoughtful essays blending his personal Buddhist beliefs, respect for wildlife and the land, and fascination with language and mythic tradition into a "meditation on what it means to be human." In "The Place, the Region, and the Commons," he relates the old English concept of the common to publicly held U.S. forests, expressing concern that Americans, who lack an intimate familiarity with the land, "are not actually living here intellectually, imaginatively, or morally." "Tawny Grammar," referring to a Spanish phrase for knowledge of nature, examines this knowledge through a school curriculum in northwest Alaska that combines traditional native values and marketable skills. "Ancient Forests of the Far West" contrasts Snyder's experience as a logger in the 1950s, when the industry still exercised restraint, with the current depletion of American woodlands. And "The Woman Who Married a Bear" comments on relations between bears and humans through a Native American myth about a girl who is carried off by a grizzly that assumes the form of a man. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Complete Conservatory Method for Trumpet</h2><p><p>A pillar among trumpet method books, this title has long set the standard for trumpet pedagogy books.

The confusion, fear, and suffering of The People are drawn with clarity and immediacy. A factual afterword gives a larger picture of the times with captioned period photographs of the Navajo. The story is rich with details of Native life gracefully woven into the telling of events. Characterizations are complete, even for minor participants.

Yet only in very recent years have scientists begun to turn the tools of modem science on this remarkable animal that has been so wrapped up in human dreams and legends. Now modern scientific research is beginning to explain long-standing mysteries about the true nature of the horse. How well can horses really see? What causes breakdowns in racehorses? How intelligent are they compared to other animals, and are some breeds smarter than others? Does nature or nurture matter more in creating a great sport horse? What causes cribbing and other vices? In this beautifully illustrated, compelling narrative, Budiansky tells the story of the origins, behavior, intelligence and language of the horse. <p> For the first time, horse lovers will have access to cutting-edge research on topics of interest including new information on horse vision, horse biology and movement. Introducing the latest archeological findings, Budiansky presents a fascinating discussion of how the horse evolved as well as a dramatic and provocative history of man's use and abuse of the horse from prehistoric times to today. In a revealing chapter on horse intelligence, he debunks the commonly held belief that horses are stupid and also presents compelling new scientific information on horse language which will greatly benefit the horse rider and trainer. Finally, drawing together the latest research on horse physiology, genetics and biomechanics, Budiansky asks the million dollar question -- what makes for a winning racehorse? Anyone who loves horses will find this an invaluable resource as well as a fascinating read.</p></p><p><b>Stephen Budiansky,</b> formerly U.S. Editor of <i>Nature,</i> is currently Senior Writer at <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report.</i> He is the author of <i>Covenant of the Wild</i> and <i>Nature's Keepers: The New Science of Nature Management.</i> He lives in Leesburg, Virginia.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>THE IMPROBABILITY OF THE HORSE</b> </p><p> Of the more than 4,000 species of mammals that have occupied the earth during the last 10,000 years, the horse is one of fewer than a dozen that have achieved widespread success as domesticated animals. </p><p> That low success rate was certainly not for want of trying on our part. The ancient Egyptians attempted to domesticate hyenas, antelope, ibex, and gazelles (figure 1.1). The American Indians kept pet raccoons, bears, and even moose. The Australian aborigines even kept wallabies and kangaroos. Yet none survive as domesticated animals today. </p><p> If it were simply a matter of human will, it would be hard to explain why we should have domestic dogs, sheep, goats, cows, pigs, horses, asses, camels, rabbits, and cats -- but not deer, squirrels, foxes, antelope, or even hippos and zebras. </p><p> The answer is that it was not a matter of human will. The successful domesticated species were largely "preadapted" to their role through quirks of adaptation and evolution that had nothing whatever to do with human intentions or needs, but that turned out to be vital to their future success in our homes and fields. The horse was no exception. Among the myriad ways of making a living that evolution has cast up, a few -- a very few -- turned out to be compatible with human ways. </p><p> The horse, like the other animals that were to enter into domestication, was a generalist, able to survive on a variety of widely available foods. (An animal such as the giant panda, which eats nothing but bamboo leaves, would surely have been a nonstarter.) These generalists were able to exploit their new domesticated niche with a high potential reproduction rate. They had relatively simple courtship patterns, typically harems in which one male readily mates with multiple females. They were social animals, instinctively given to understanding signals of dominance and submission. They were relatively nonterritorial, not given to disruptive intraspecies combat over fixed bits of ground. In other words, the first step toward domestication was one that nature took millions of years before we even arrived on the scene. </p><p> The second step also seems to have been more the doing of the animals than of us. It was animals who discovered the mutual compatibility of our species, and it was they who chose to act upon this discovery. Recent archaeological and animal behavior studies strongly support the idea that domestication was not the human invention it was long supposed to have been, but rather a long, slow process of mutual adaptation, of "coevolution," in which those animals that began to hang around the first permanent human settlements gained more than they lost. Some were killed and eaten, but for every cow or sheep or horse killed, many more flourished on the crops they robbed from our fields and the incidental protection they gained from other predators in the proximity of human habitations. Like the starlings, mice and rats, and chimney swifts that invade our homes today for the food and shelter that are a by-product of our domestic habits, those forebears of our domestic stock took the initiative. We followed. </p><p> In the process, these semidomesticated but still free-living animals acquired still more of the characteristics that would make full domestication possible. Those individuals that were more curious, less territorial, less aggressive, more dependent, better able to deflect human aggression through submission, were the individuals that had the edge in this new niche. </p><p> It was only in the third stage of domestication, when humans began breeding animals in captivity, that human "invention" began to play a predominant role. But in consciously selecting and emphasizing those traits that appealed to our fancy or our needs, we could still only draw upon what nature provided. If the horse had not existed, we most definitely could not have invented it. The species upon which agriculture and indeed civilization have been built were a remarkable gift of evolutionary chance and opportunism. </p><p> <b><i>The Disadvantage of Being a Horse</i></b> </p><p> A number of species that expanded their range throughout the world during the respites that punctuated the Ice Age glaciations of the Pleistocene epoch (15,000 to 2 million years ago) may have acquired "domesticated" traits as a package deal. The twin pressures of climatic upheaval and massive hunting by humans placed specialist feeders at a decided disadvantage; it was the generalists, which could adapt to a wide variety of climates and circumstances, that flourished. Moreover, it was those species that were migratory, curious, adaptable -- as opposed to territorial, suspicious, and conservative -- that thrived on upheaval. Sheep, wolves, cattle, goats, camels, and horses all fit this bill. Thus in at least one sense the coincidence of domestication seems a bit more comprehensible: there were sound evolutionary reasons that made horses ripe for domestication. Even tameability may have been part of this package. The pressures that placed a premium on adaptability favored the retention into adulthood of juvenile characteristics, an evolutionary process known as neoteny. Juveniles are curious and adaptable, traits that were in demand in the Pleistocene; they are also playful, submissive, and dependent, traits that proved valuable to man in domestication. </p><p> Yet horses possessed a number of other remarkably convenient characteristics -- convenient from our point of view -- that make the existence of the modern horse seem all the more astonishing. To begin with, its very survival to modern times was practically a fluke. Many things worked against the horse ever making it. The speed, size, and weight-bearing capacity of the modern horse, all vital to its utility to humans, are extraordinarily unusual among mammals. An animal the size of the horse is in fact a prime candidate for extinction, a fact borne out repeatedly in the fossil record of life on earth. Large animals are long-lived as a rule, but they are also slow to reach sexual maturity, require long gestation periods, and rarely bear more than one young at a time. A drought, an insect outbreak that strips vegetation bare, or any other climatic or ecological disturbance can deliver a blow to a population of large-bodied animals that it takes years to recover from -- if it recovers at all. A population of small animals that reproduce quickly and in large litters, on the other hand, can bounce back from repeated calamities. </p><p> Large animals face other evolutionary risks, not least of all gravity. Thomas McMahon, a biomechanician at Harvard University who has made an extensive study of the biology of size, notes that when an animal falls the damage it does to itself is directly proportional to its height, or length. (McMahon's argument in a nutshell: The strength of bones is proportional to their cross-sectional area. An animal twice as tall or twice as long as another will have bones that are twice as thick in all of their dimensions; their cross-sectional area will thus be 2 x 2 = 4 times as great [see figure 1.2]. If an animal's body length is proportional to <i>L,</i> the cross-sectional area of its bones will be proportional to length squared, L2. On the other hand, the energy of a falling body is proportional to its mass, and mass typically increases with the cube of an animal's length, or L3, because an animal twice as long as another will, roughly speaking, also be twice as wide and twice as tall, so its total volume will be eight times as great: 2 x 2 x 2 = 8. So if the energy of an impact is proportional to length cubed, and the ability to resist damage is proportional to length squared, the ratio of the two is [L3/L2], which equals just plain <i>L.</i> The old adage is true: the bigger they are, the harder they fall.) As the renowned British zoologist J. B. S. Haldane observed, "You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes." </p><p> As we shall see, there were some compensating evolutionary virtues that made large size attractive, but that does not alter the initial fact of the relative rarity, and improbability, of animals the size of horses. </p><p> The speed of the horse is a rarity, too; indeed, it has few equals in speed over long distances. The cheetah, the fastest land animal, can hit 100 kilometers per hour for extremely short bursts over a distance of a hundred meters or so; a horse's sustained racing gallop is nearly 70 kilometers per hour. </p><p> At the same time, the horse's dietary needs are astonishingly easy to meet for such a large animal. The black rhino, an animal whose body weight is comparable to that of a large draft horse, requires huge quantities of green twigs and legumes. Large carnivores of similar weight, such as polar bears or lions, will eat up to 40 kilograms of meat in a single meal. Yet the horse has adapted to eating the poorest-quality forage, containing the lowest concentration of protein, of any large herbivore. It thrives on grasses that a cow would starve to death on. </p><p> And unlike many large grazing animals, horses break down the otherwise indigestible cellulose of stems and leaves in a digestive organ known as the cecum. While ruminants such as sheep and cattle have to rest for hours after eating, the hoofed herbivores that possess a cecal digestive system (horses, tapirs, and rhinos) can eat and run. </p><p> It is another remarkable and happy coincidence that the horse possesses a diastema, or gap between the front incisors and the rear grinders (figure 1.3). Control of the horse by man would have proved far more difficult without this anatomical convenience, which allowed the effective placement of bridle and bit. </p><p> Horses possess one final anatomical convenience from our point of view: almost unique among hoofed animals, they lack horns or antlers. </p><p> <b><i>The Nature of Evolution</i></b> </p><p> The sheer abundance of horse bones, and especially horse teeth, in the fossil record has made the horse the single most frequently cited paradigm of evolution. There are more than half a million specimens of fossil horses in museum and academic collections in North America alone. </p><p> Explaining evolution has never been easy, and educators and museum curators quite naturally seized on the well-documented fossil history of the ever popular horse as Exhibit A. Practically everyone who has visited a science museum or taken an elementary biology course has seen the evolutionary sequence of fossil horses from tiny eohippus (more properly known by its scientific name, <i>Hyracotherium)</i> to modern <i>Equus.</i> Starting as a small, squat, dog-sized, four-toed creature 55 million years ago, the horse step-by-step turned into the tall, fleet, elegant, single-hoofed animal of modernity. </p><p> But this simple, linear picture of evolution has led to a couple of unfortunate misunderstandings. One is the idea that evolution really does run in a straight line. This notion, known technically as orthogenesis, was assumed by many early biologists, and is still the popular conception of how evolution works: each species in an animal's fossil family tree gives rise to a (presumably superior) replacement. "The orthogenetic template has...influenced millions of lay people, many of whom visit natural history museums with turn-of-the-century exhibits that convey 100-year-old ideas," says paleontologist Bruce MacFadden, an expert on fossil horses. In fact, paleontologists now know that evolution is full of branches, dead ends, and blind turns. </p><p> The recent history of modern equids is no exception. Analysis of the similarity of mitochondrial DNA among the seven modern species of the genus <i>Equus</i> (three zebras, two asses, the horse, and the now-extinct, zebralike quagga of South Africa, which was hunted to its death in the late-nineteenth century) has allowed scientists to reconstruct a branching family tree that is surely far more paradigmatic of evolution than any straight-line model (plate 1). Mitochondrial DNA is the genetic material found in a portion of the cell known as the mitochondria, which is responsible for generating energy and which has the peculiarity of reproducing itself separately from the rest of the cell. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited solely from the mother. Thus, changes in mitochondrial DNA can occur only slowly, by accumulated mutation, not by the recombination of male and female genes through mating in every generation. By comparing this DNA in related species and estimating the mutation rate at 2 percent every million years, biologists have calculated when the various modern <i>Equus</i> species diverged from one another. (The extinct quagga's mitochondrial DNA was extracted from a bit of muscle tissue in a preserved hide at the Museum of Natural History in Mainz, Germany; it appears to have diverged from <i>Equus zebra</i> 3 to 4 million years ago.) </p><p> The other, related misperception that the orthogenetic model of evolution has engendered is that evolution has a purpose, or goal. It is commonplace, and perhaps inevitable, for people in love with horses to see this 55-million-year history as a process of "perfecting" the horse. We often read that the horse is "perfectly" adapted to running, for instance, and it is hard for us not to see modern <i>Equus</i> as superior to its forebears. </p><p> In fact, the evolutionary explosion of the horse in North America beginning some 20 million years ago gave rise to a multiplicity of other branches, too, with as many as 13 genera existing simultaneously. Some species were larger than their predecessors, but some were smaller (figure 1.4). Some moved toward the "modern" horse diet of grasses, but others specialized in the "primitive" diet of browse (figure 1.5). Some showed a trend toward the one-toed hoof of the modern equid, others did not. </p><p> The first step toward understanding how evolutionary forces shaped the modern horse is to understand that the purpose of evolution is not progress or perfection in the long run, but survival in the short run. And that in turn involves a complex interaction of genes and the environment. It is simply wrong to say that the modern horse is "superior" to its extinct predecessors. Many of those predecessors that we so cavalierly dismiss as failures, or as inferior stepping stones on the path to perfection, were in fact brilliant successes that flourished for millions of years -- until an unpredictable change in climate finally did them in. The evolutionary success of the modern horse owes more to its having been a lucky guesser than a pinnacle of progress. That is especially borne out by the fact that abrupt climatic changes at the end of the Ice Age some 15,000 years ago (possibly exacerbated by overhunting by humans) drove the modern horse to extinction in North America and within a hair's breadth of extinction in Europe and Asia as well. Were it not for domestication, <i>Equus caballus</i> would have gone the way of <i>Hyracotherium</i> and all the other ancestral horses that are testimony to the inevitability of extinction. </p><p> A new trait, however meritorious it may prove in the long run, cannot become fixed ...</p></p><h2>Tree of Life: The Incredible Biodiversity of Life on Earth (CitizenKid)</h2><p>If every known species on Earth were a leaf on a tree, that tree would have 1 750 000 leaves. Since humans count for just one leaf on the tree, we have a lot to learn about the millions of other forms of life with which we share the world. A dazzlingly illustrated and child-friendly introduction to biodiversity, Tree of Life shows how living things are classified into five kingdoms -- and how each has much to tell us about all aspects of life on our planet. Tree of Life is part of CitizenKid: A collection of books that inform children about the world and inspire them to be better global citizens.</p><p>Rochelle Strauss is an environmental education consultant in Toronto. She has designed and developed education programs, as well as consulted on numerous environmental projects, including a biodiversity museum in Panama and a national park in Canada.Grade 5-7&#x2013;A handsome presentation in a slender, oversized format, generously illustrated with impressive, informative acrylics. Strauss's clearly written text first introduces the concept of a family tree for all living things, then goes on to name the five kingdoms of scientific classification (those programmed for "Protists" will have to adapt to "Protoctista" here). On two-page spreads, the author describes the life-forms included in each species, with specific examples shown in the softly colorful illustrations accompanied by informative captions. The Animal Kingdom comprises the longest segment as it is broken down into invertebrates and vertebrates, with the latter divided still further into fish, birds, and so on. Two closing units discuss habitat loss and its effect on biodiversity, and how one can protect the environment. A final entry aimed at "Parents, Teachers and Guardians" explains the history of scientific classification, discusses the importance of biodiversity to this planet, and provides some suggestions for fostering a biodiversity ethic in young people. This book might be paired with Steve Jenkins's equally attractive <i>Life on Earth</i> (Houghton, 2002) to demonstrate just how biodiversity became such a rich, multilayered conglomeration. Striking, lucid, and deceptively simple.<i>&#x2013;Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is the true story of how Schwartz became the best of the best, of the people and places he discovered along the way and of the trader's tricks and techniques he used to make his millions.<p>Writing with great verve and style, Schwartz makes us a part of the action as we follow his career from his first gut-wrenching day trading options on the American Stock Exchange to his enormous successes trading futures, his pursuit of secretive foreign money for his hedge fund, the night he spent trading bonds during the Golf War (in that first tumultuous night, he made $1.2 million by dawn), and the often painful yet valuable personal lessons he learned the hard way.</p><p>It's a high-pressure, high-stakes world rarely seen by outsiders and rarely written about by its inhabitants. Here, fortunes are made and lost in moments, and nobody brings it to life better than Marty Schwartz, the man <em>Barron's</em>&nbsp; calls "the best there is." His stories are irresistable, and his candid accounts of his smart moves and blunders alike are priceless.</p><p>Appended to each chapter are fascinating "lessons" Schwartz has learned about the financial markets--where you'll learn about the attitude, style and strategies that make Schwartz a winner. For the real nuts and bolts, turn to the end of the book and plunge into "The Pit Bull's Guide to Successful Trading," a manual covering Schwartz' favorite trading methods, market analysis tools and indicators. </p><p>Whether you want to play the markets yourself, are curious about how the buccaneer traders of Wall Street make (and lose) their money or simply want to be entertained by a rollicking good story, <em>Pit Bull</em>&nbsp; is a book you won't want to miss.</p></p><p><br> Martin S. Schwartz is a legendary Wall Street trader who made his fortune successfully trading stocks, futures, and options. He has been profiled in Barron's and in the national bestseller Market Wizards by Jack D. Schwager.A Wall Street trader exercises a rich man's prerogative and offers financial advice and his life story. ``See how much money I made!'' is the message. ``I'm pretty smart and damned tough, too.'' To be sure, Schwartz (``Buzzy'' to his pals) is the prototypical hard driver, a truly successful day trader, buying and selling in lightning strokes for his own account. His is a talent for exquisite market timing, a tricky game for even the most proficient professionals. His specialty is S&amp;P futures, a technique using the marvel of leverage to greatly multiply the chances for gainor losson each tick. It requires an inordinate amount of research as well as stamina, acumen, and nerve, but it can be worth millions every year. The alternative, as Buzzy frets, is ``going tapioca.'' Buzzy dearly wanted his kids to say, `` `My daddy's the Champion Trader!' That was all I cared about,'' he admits. With success came Lutce lunches, expensive artworks, Armani suits, Bally alligator shoes, and other trophies. Schwartz essays a little false humility, but the book's evasive charm is based on chutzpah. In an effort to leverage with OPM (other people's money), the author established his own hedge funds until investors (the bastards) pestered him about their money. Don't be surprised to learn the result was heart disease. Now in Florida, trading again for himself, the quondam Champion Trader reveals, with some repetition, his story. It moves nicely, though, with a certain egomaniacal verve. An appendix gives the author's daily schedule (e.g, ``7:20-7:30 Clean out the plumbing''). His investment methodology is also appended, but only the most devoted professional will utilize this rigorous lesson. An archetypal text, true to life on the Street, destined to be discussed over drinks at trader hangouts after the market closesand better than going tapioca.

Late morning, early evening: I could not judge. I stood on the crest of a low hill, between thick black trunks smooth as glass. Behind me, a dense enclosure of more black trunks. And ahead...detail rushed upon me; I sucked it in with frantic need.<br>Red and purple forest pushed over low boxy hills, fading to pink and lavender as the hills receded toward the horizon. Mist curled languidly between. Immense trees like the skeletons of cathedral towers punctuated the forest every few hundred meters, pink crowns perched atop four slender vaulting legs, rising high over the rest of the forest. Above the hills, sky beckoned crystal blue with mottled patches of more red and purple, as if reflecting the forest. In fact, the forest inhabited the sky: tethered gas-filled balloons ascended from the distant stands of black-trunked trees into thin shredded-ribbon clouds.<br>Everything glowed with serene yellow light and brilliant blood-hued life. Everything, related. For as far as the eye could see--what Darrow Jan Fima had called Elizabeth&#x2019;s Zone, one creature, one <em>thing</em>.<br>From where I stood, at the top of a rise overlooking the broad, dark olive Terra Nova River, Lamarckia hardly seemed <em>violated</em>. Not a human in sight, not a curl of smoke or rise of structure. Somewhere below, hidden in the tangle of smooth black trunks, huge round leaves, and purple fans, the ferry landing was supposed to be...And inland a few hundred meters along a dirt and gravel path, both hidden in the dense pack, the village of Moonrise.<br>I touched my clothes self-consciously. How out-of-place would I look?<br>I realized I had been holding my breath. I inhaled deeply. It was a sweet and startling breath. The air smelled of fresh water, grapes, tea leaves, and a variety of odors I can only describe as skunky-sweet. Rich aromas wafted from nearby extrusions resembling broad purple flowers, with fleshy centers. They smelled like bananas, spicy as cinnamon. The extrusions opened and closed, twitching at the end of each cycle. Then they withdrew altogether with thin, high chirps.<br>I reached out my hand to stroke the smooth black curve of a trunk. At my touch, the bark parted to form a kind of stoma, red and pink pulp within. A drop of translucent white fluid oozed from the gash, which quickly closed when I lifted my hand.<br>&#x201c;Not a tree,&#x201c; I murmured. The Dalgesh report--by the original surveyors--had called them &#x201c;arborid scions.&#x201d; And this was not a forest, but a <em>silva</em>.<br>There were no plants or animals as such on Lamarckia. The first surveyors, in the single day they had spent on the planet, had determined that within certain zones, all apparently individual organisms, called scions, in fact belonged to a larger organism, which they had called an ecos. No scion could breed by itself; they did not act alone. An ecos was a single genetic organism, creating within itself all the diverse parts of an ecosystem, spread over large areas--in some cases, dominating entire continents.<br>Each ecos was ruled, the surveyors had theorized, by what they called a seed mistress, or queen. Neither the surveyors--nor the immigrants, according to Jan Fima--had ever seen such a queen, however; understanding of Lamarckian biology and planetary science in general had still been primitive among the immigrants when the informer left.<br>Above, the black trunks spread great round parasol-leaves, broad as outstretched arms, powdery gray at their perimeters, rose and bloodred in their centers. The parasols rubbed edges in a canopy-clinging current of air, making a gentle shushing noise, like a mother calming an infant. Black granular dust fell in thin drifts on my head; not pollen, certainly not ash. I rubbed some between my fingers, smelled it, but did not taste.<br>The last light of the orange sun warmed my face. So this was not morning but evening; the day was ending. I savored the glow. It felt wonderfully, thrillingly familiar; but it was the first sunlight I had ever directly experienced. Until now, I had spent my whole life within Thistledown and the Way.<br>My terror passed into numb ecstasy. The sense of alien newness, of unfamiliar beauty, hit me like a drug; I was actually walking on a <em>planet</em>, a world like Earth, not within a hollowed-out rock.<br>Reluctantly, I turned from the sun&#x2019;s warmth and walked in shadow down an overgrown trail. If I had come out in the right place, this trail would lead to the Terra Nova River and the landing that served the village of Moonrise. Here, I had been told, I might catch a riverboat and travel to Calcutta, the largest town on the continent of Elizabeth&#x2019;s Land.<br>I wondered what sort of people I would meet. I imagined feral wretches, barely social, clustered in dark little towns, immersed in their own superstitions. Then I regretted the thought. Perhaps I had spent too much time among the Geshels, having so little respect for my own kind. But of course Lenk&#x2019;s people had gone beyond my own kind. Yanosh had characterized them as fanatic.<br>The moist air of the river valley sighed around me, like an invisible chilly flood. Picking my footsteps carefully, avoiding lines of finger-sized orange worms topped by feathery blue crests, I listened for any sounds, heard only the rubbed-silk hiss of air and the liquid mumble of the river.<br>The trail at least had once been traveled by humans. Dropped between the trunks, in a tangle of stone-hard &#x201c;roots,&#x201c; I spotted a small scrap of crumpled plastic and knelt to pick it up. Spread open by my fingers, it was a blank page from an erasable notebook.<br>At least, I realized with considerably relief, I had not arrived <em>before</em>the human intruders. That would have meant I was truly trapped here, with no chance of returning until they arrived...Or someone came from the Hexamon to get me.<br>I pocketed the scrap. I still could not be sure how much time had passed since the arrival of Lenk and his followers.<br>Four thousand one hundred and fourteen illegal immigrants; as much as three decades between my arrival and theirs. What could they have done to Lamarckia in that time?<br>I pushed through a tangle of purple helixed blades. My feet sank into a grainy, boggy humus littered with pink shells and pebbles. No landing visible; no lights, no sign of river traffic. For a moment, I knelt and dug my fingers into the soil. It felt gritty and resilient at once--grains of sand and spongy corklike cubes half a centimeter on a side, suspended in inky fluid that globbed immiscibly amid drops of clear water. It looked for all the world like gardener&#x2019;s potting soil mixed with viscous ink.<br>I picked up a pink shell. Spiral, flat, like an ancient Earth ammonite, four or five centimeters across. I sniffed it; clean and sweet, with a watery, dusty smell backed by a ghost of roses and bananas. I poked it with a finger; it crushed easily.<br>More black powder fell in thin curtains nearby. I glanced up and saw what looked like an immense reddish-brown snake, banded with deep midnight blue, dozens of meters long and as thick across as my own body, twisted around and draped across the trunks and leaves above. It wriggled slowly, peristaltically. I could see neither its head nor its tail. With a clamping sensation in my throat and chest, I trotted down the trail, trying to get out from under the serpent.<br>The trail became thicker, overgrown by smaller red and purple plantlike forms, <em>phytids</em>, filling in between the arborids. I lost my way and had to listen for the sound of the river to orient myself.<br>Several minutes passed before I realized I was smelling something out of place, rich and gassy. During my walk, I had not once smelled mold or methane, not once felt the squelch of dead vegetation. Plants, trees--convenient words only--grew from soil that might have been prepared by diligent and cleanly gardeners. Only the pink shells, mired in the mud, gave a hint that anything here lived, then died, and in dying, left remains--<br>And this fresh scent of decay.<br>I thrashed down to the bank again and stared over the deep brownish water to the black silhouette of the opposite shore. Faint, broad patches of blue glow sprang up between the trees across the river. They sputtered and went out again. I could not be sure I had seen them. Then, high above, the undersides of the broad parasols flashed blue. Somewhere, high-pitched tuneless whistling. A flutter beneath the parasols: dark winged things carrying fibrous scraps. Something small and red darted past my face with an audible sniff.<br>The wind died. The night air sank. Fog danced and twisted in the middle of the river. With the silence came another whiff of decay. Animal flesh, rotting. I was sure of that much.<br>I followed the scent Back up the bank, stepping gingerly over writhing purple creepers, guided by faint blue flashes through the undergrowth, I found the remains of the trail.<br>Something made a sound between a squeak and a sigh and scuttled on three legs out of the undergrowth: a pasty white creature the size of a small dog, triangular in shape. It stood by a black trunk and regarded me through patient, empty eye-spots mounted along a red central line. It pulsed and made tiny whistling sounds. Its skin crawled in what I took to be disgust at my presence. But apparently disgust was only disapproval--or something else entirely--for it did not retreat. Instead, it slowly clasped and crawled its way up a trunk, opened a stoma with a tap of its pointed tail-foot, and began to suck milky fluid. I watched in fascination as its white body swelled. Then, half again as large as before, the creature dropped from the trunk, landed in the dirt with a rubbery plop, and crabbed away with a half circling gait on the down-bent points of its triangle.<br>Twilight was quickly obscuring everything. A double oxbow of stars pricked through the thin clouds. Ahead, a flickering orange light drew my attention: a torch or flame.

Stanley begins with a concise overview of the First Crusade, then hypothesizes about the impact of the Franks' murderous conquest of Jerusalem on the young Saladin, a devout Muslim (after listing Jerusalem's importance to the "three great religions," the boy poses a question: "Couldn't everyone just share it?"). The author outlines religious practices, the political history of the Middle East and of Western Europe, and the vexed military campaigns for Jerusalem, once again demonstrating her trademark ability to research and then distill complex topics in terms accessible to middle-graders. She painstakingly builds readers' sense of Saladin's integrity and skilled leadership. For example, when his army was poised for certain victory over the Christians holding Jerusalem, he wrote to a knight proposing generous conditions for their surrender: "I believe that Jerusalem is the House of God, as you also believe. And I will not willingly lay siege to the House of God or put it to the assault." Stanley's precise, detailed artwork pays homage to period architecture. She evokes the colors of Persian miniatures (and medieval stained glass) as her paintings incorporate the complex patterning associated with Islamic art. Portraits of Saladin at home, sitting in front of gorgeously tiled walls with his family, arrayed in sumptuous robes, are particularly effective in conveying the richness of the subject's world. Readers are certain to be intrigued.

Something in his character has kept him always at a distance, preventing him from giving himself wholeheartedly to the woman he loves and from becoming the father that he knows his children deserve. So before he loses everything he cares about, Andrew sets out to look for answers. <br><br>Hobbling up the treacherous slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro, dodging gregarious passengers aboard an Amazonian riverboat, and trudging through dense Costa Rican rain forests&#x2014;Andrew takes us on exotic trips to some of the world&#x2019;s most beautiful places, but his real journey is one of the spirit. <br><br>On his soul-searching voyages, Andrew traces the path from his New Jersey roots, where acting saved his life&#x2014;and early fame almost took it away&#x2014;to his transformation into a leading travel writer. He faces the real costs of his early success and lays bare the evolving nature of his relationships with women. He explores a strained bond with his father, and how this complex dynamic shapes his own identity as a parent. Andrew charts his journey from ambivalence to confidence, from infidelity and recklessness to acceptance and a deeper understanding of the internal conflicts of his life. <br><br>A gifted writer with an unsparing eye, Andrew relishes bizarre encounters with the characters whom he encounters, allowing them to challenge him in unexpected ways. He gets into peculiar, even dangerous situations that put him to the test&#x2014;with mixed results. Disarmingly likable, Andrew is open, honest, and authentic on every page, and what emerges is an intimate memoir of self-discovery and an unforgettable love song to the woman who would be his wife.</p><p>Andrew McCarthy is a writer, actor, and director. He is an editor-at-large with National Geographic Traveler and has written for The New York Times, The Atlantic, and The Wall Street Journal. The Society of American Travel Writers named him Travel Journalist of the Year in 2010 and presented him their Grand Award in 2011. McCarthy made his acting debut at nineteen and has appeared in dozens of films, including Pretty in Pink, St. Elmo&#39;s Fire, and The Joy Luck Club.

Gone were the backyard Wiffle ball games with my brothers that had defined my summer afternoons, as was the small maple tree in the front yard that I nearly succeeded in chopping down with a rubber ax when I was eight; over were the nights lying in bed talking to my older brother Peter across the room in the dark before sleep came. We had lived atop a small hill, safely in the center of a suburban block, in a three-bedroom colonial with green shutters; now we would live in a long and low house in a swale on a large corner lot a half hour and a world away.<br> <br>&#x201c;It looks like a motel,&#x201d; I said when I first saw our new home. Unwittingly, I had spoken to the temporary quality that our lives were about to take on. My eldest brother had just gone off to college, ending the daily battles with my father&#x2014;no longer would my dad chase Stephen out the window and across the yard in a rage. Peter&#x2019;s star, which had burned so bright, grew suddenly and temporarily tarnished&#x2014;driving and girlfriends usurped the passion for sports that had occupied his early years, yet he continued to look after me with a fierce protectiveness. My younger brother, Justin, eight years my junior, was slotted into a new school and tumbled in the wake left by the rest of us.<br> <br>Instead of feeling more confident after our move into the larger home, my parents grew tense. More and more often, when the phone rang, I could hear my father&#x2019;s voice echoing from somewhere in the cavernous house, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not here! I&#x2019;m not here!&#x201d; Whoever was looking for him, he did not want to be found. At the same time, my mother grew more remote due to an illness that we children knew of only vaguely&#x2014;it was never discussed with us. In all this space, my family seemed to be coming apart. I was fourteen.<br> <br>A quiet child, I&#x2019;d had a rotation of friends and a cycle of movement in my old neighborhood, the loss of which left me untethered. There were woods across the road from our new home and I began to spend more and more time, alone, picking through the trees and building dams in the stream. Always in the shadow of my brother Peter&#x2019;s athletic ability, my passion for sports waned. I was never a diligent student, and as the work piled up, my interest faded. Noticing my rudderless unease, my mother suggested I try out for the school musical, Oliver. Reluctantly, I went along. When it came to the final audition for the role of the Artful Dodger, I surprised myself with how much I wanted the part. Pitted against another student who, it was made very clear, had a better singing voice and was more desired for the production, I threw myself into my performance in a way that left them no option but to reward me with the role.<br> <br>In describing first love, the playwright Tennessee Williams once wrote, &#x201c;It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been in half shadow.&#x201d; I experienced a similarly wondrous sense of discovery with that first role. I felt the power and belonging I had been searching for, without knowing that I had been searching at all. I knew my experience onstage was a profound one because I told no one of its effect on me.<br> <br>A few years later, when the time came to apply to college, with few options because of my poor grades, I quietly took the train to Hoboken, then the PATH under the Hudson River, and went to a building off Washington Square in Greenwich Village. On the second floor of a windowless room I spoke a few paragraphs of a play I had read only a portion of, in front of a petite man with an effete manner who wore a bow tie and a waxed mustache.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sit down,&#x201d; he said when I was finished. He wanted to know why my grades were so bad and why I wanted to come to acting school. He asked if I had another monologue I could perform for him. I could do some of the lines from the Artful Dodger, I said. When I was finished he looked at me for a long while. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said at last, &#x201c;here&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re going to do. I&#x2019;m going to get you into this school, if I can. I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;ll place you on academic probation to start. You&#x2019;re going to get good grades and be grateful to me for the rest of your life.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds good,&#x201d; I said, slipping on an attitude of casual indifference to mask the thrill I felt.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;No son of mine is going to be a fucking thespian,&#x201d; my father snapped when he learned of the audition&#x2014;but when no other college accepted me, he had no choice.<br> <br>This was the same man who then drove me into the city and knocked on door after door until we found an apartment for me to live in just off Washington Square Park when the university refused me housing. And it was during the buoyant ride back to New Jersey that we played &#x201c;Thank God I&#x2019;m a Country Boy&#x201d; on his John Denver tape, over and over again. I bowed the air fiddle and he lowered the windows and the wind ripped through the car as we sang at the top of our lungs with our hearts wide open to each other.<br> <br>As I packed my bags to leave home, my mother offered me a painting that I had always admired&#x2014;a large canvas with the profile of a hawk, its golden eye staring boldly out at the viewer. When my father saw it leaning against the wall by the door, instead of on the living room wall, he grew enraged.<br> <br>&#x201c;That painting is not leaving this house,&#x201d; he barked. &#x201c;That is my favorite piece of art.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother, who rarely engaged with my father when he lost his temper, pushed back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m giving it to him,&#x201d; she declared. &#x201c;He is leaving for school and I want him to have it.&#x201d;<br> <br>A vicious fight ensued. I knew, even in the midst of the shouting, that this had nothing to do with a painting and everything to do with a mother losing her son in whom she had been overinvested, and a father who had resented their closeness.<br> <br>A few months after I had settled in my apartment, my father made one of his many unscheduled visits, carrying the painting. He presented it as if it were a new idea to offer it to me. I tried to refuse but it was no use. When he left, I put the painting in the back of a closet, and when I moved from that apartment, I gave it away.<br> <br><br> <br>The man who had gone out on a limb and gotten me into NYU was Fred Gorlick. He rarely acknowledged me when I saw him at school, and he left shortly after I arrived. I never saw him again. I have been grateful to him for my entire life, but I could only keep half my word. Somehow I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to attend my nonacting classes, and after two years, the powers that be at school asked me to leave.<br> <br>A few months later another transient angel swept across my path.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wanted: Eighteen, vulnerable and sensitive&#x201d; read the ad in the newspaper. I hadn&#x2019;t seen it, but a friend called and told me about the audition. I got on the number 1 train and went to the Upper West Side. I sat on the floor of a hallway in the Ansonia Hotel on Seventy-third Street and waited for three hours with several hundred other eighteen-year-old, vulnerable and sensitive hopefuls. I had never been to an &#x201c;open call&#x201d; before; I had never been to a movie audition.<br> <br>When I was finally called into the room, I handed my headshot to a man with soft features who immediately flipped it over to look at my r�sum�. I had acted in exactly one professional play, for one weekend. The play was listed there, alone on the white page.<br> <br>&#x201c;You spelled the author&#x2019;s name wrong,&#x201d; the man with the soft features said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I responded meekly, &#x201c;sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then he looked over his shoulder to a woman with a head full of untamed blond hair, who was busy with work of her own. She looked up, glanced at me briefly, and nodded. The man with the soft features turned back and said, &#x201c;Come to our office tomorrow.&#x201d; He wrote the address and time on a piece of paper.<br> <br>I went to the office the next day and was handed a scene from what I assumed was a movie script. I read it with the same man, whose name I learned was David, and went away. The following week I was summoned to meet the director of the film, Lewis Carlino, in his suite at a midtown hotel. He was a gentle, soft-spoken man with a trim gray beard. We chatted for a while, and then I left. As I waited by the elevator, David came out and asked me back to the office again the following day. We read the same scene I had before. This time, Lewis was also present and they were recording me on videotape. I was nervous and knew I was performing poorly, unable to follow the director&#x2019;s suggestions. Worse, my eyes unwittingly opened wide, apparently giving me a look of frozen terror.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just relax your eyes,&#x201d; Lewis said kindly.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know what he was talking about.<br> <br>I left, disheartened, knowing that I had lost any chance for the part.<br> <br>Six weeks later I pushed the button on my roommate&#x2019;s new answering machine on the floor just inside his bedroom. And there was David&#x2019;s voice, asking if I could come in to the office yet again.<br> <br>Marty Ransohoff, the film&#x2019;s producer, had seen the tape and saw something he liked. &#x201c;He looks crazy, like Tony Perkins in Psycho,&#x201d; Marty had said.<br> <br>I was brought to Chicago to meet and screen-test with other actors, and finally I was flown out to Los Angeles to meet with Jacqueline Bisset&#x2014;the role I was to play was that of her young lover and she needed to approve the choice.<br> <br>At the Ch�teau Marmont hotel, beside the room where John Belushi had recently overdosed, I waited for the call. Marty picked me up in his Jaguar. He was an outsized man in every way, and as we drove up Benedict Canyon, he told me, &#x201c;Just be yourself, kid.&#x201d;<br> <br>A tall blond Adonis answered the door. He spoke with a thick Russian accent. &#x201c;It is a pleasure to meet you,&#x201d; he said, and extended his well-tanned hand. It was Jacqueline Bisset&#x2019;s lover, the recently defected Russian ballet star Alexander Godunov.<br> <br>I entered the Spanish-style bungalow and slouched on the couch in the sunken living room. Marty parked himself in a plush chair nearby. We sat in silence. He never took his eyes off me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just relax, kid,&#x201d; Marty said after a while.<br> <br>Then I heard a distant toilet flush, and I started to laugh. Jackie entered the room and sat on the ottoman across from me. She was gracious, interested, and extremely beautiful. I don&#x2019;t remember anything I said, but after a few minutes she turned to Marty and said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s cheeky,&#x201d; in her lush English accent. &#x201c;I like him.&#x201d;<br> <br>We were done&#x2014;Marty drove me back down the hill and dropped me at a taxi stand to get a cab back to my hotel.<br> <br>The film, called Class, was shot in Chicago. I lived in a hotel off Michigan Avenue for the duration of the shoot. I was nineteen. The acting work was the realization of my youthful dreams, but it was in that room, a yellow-walled junior suite with a king-size bed and a partial view of the lake, that I felt at home in a way that I hadn&#x2019;t before. Alone, far from everyone I knew, with work to do, I felt insulated and safe.<br> <br>When the film ended, I returned to New York. I found no work for another year, except playing the role of Pepsi Boy in a Burger King commercial&#x2014;it didn&#x2019;t matter. My life finally had direction, and I followed it unequivocally.<br> <br>At twenty-one I landed a part in a movie called Catholic Boys (someone later changed it to Heaven Help Us), and the success that happened next happened fast. That I was unprepared, or ill-equipped, to best capitalize on my good fortune is something best decided in hindsight. My life was rushing forward; I was not interested in stopping it. Nor would I have been interested in anyone&#x2019;s advice on how I might do things differently, had anyone offered any. I was comfortable in my own company and convinced I knew my own mind.<br> <br>Work led to more work and more travel. To Los Angeles, of course, and to Philadelphia and Kentucky, Kansas and Canada. I traveled to Paris and then London, to Italy and Brazil. Because of my natural inclination toward solitude I drifted away from the others after the workday ended and wandered the cities alone. I began to find comfort in the transience and invisibility of being a stranger in a strange place. Unnoticed and anonymous, I was relieved and excited as I discovered a world very different from the suburban New Jersey neighborhood of my childhood.<br> <br>Success was something I craved&#x2014;and yet it intimidated me. These mixed feelings were not new; ambivalence had already begun to assert itself in my life and had become hugely important in the most successful role of my early film work. I was an unlikely choice for the lead male role in Pretty in Pink&#x2014;a now-iconic coming-of-age love story. At the time of filming, it seemed to me like a silly movie about a girl wanting to go to a dance. I was an oversensitive youth cast as a &#x201c;hunk,&#x201d; a twenty-two-year-old, middle-class kid playing a seventeen-year-old boy of privilege. What gave my portrayal impact and contributed to the movie&#x2019;s popularity at the time, and its enduring relevance, was the ambivalence I brought to the role: the character&#x2019;s uncertainty regarding his place in the world echoed my own and spoke to a generation of young women and men.<br> <br>In St. Elmo&#x2019;s Fire, that same ambivalence was amplified to an even greater degree and became the defining characteristic of a role that fit me better than any other. In that instance, because I was so actively living out my personal vacillations on-screen, I felt free&#x2014;for the only time in my young life&#x2014;to move fully toward a success I had decided I wanted. Only when the outlet of acting in that role was finished did my doubts and reservations return&#x2014;and by then success was on its way.<br> <br>Those films carried such weight with their intended audience because they gave credence to and took seriously the struggles of being young. Struggles I too was wrestling with at the time, and that I chose to ease through drinking. What began as a curiosity became a companion, then an emboldening habit, and finally an invisible albatross. Had I been interested in camaraderie, or allowing anyone to come close to me, someone might have pointed out that my drinking was in danger of derailing my plans&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s doubtful I would have listened. Alcohol became my master with impunity.<br> <br>While still in my mid-twenties, I wrapped up work on a film in Berlin and returned to my hotel room alone with a bottle of Jameson Irish Whiskey. I toasted myself in the mirror for a job well done and then awoke in a different room. I had no recollection of changing rooms. Confused and still groggy, I rolled over in bed and called the front desk. A man answered the phone in a language that wasn&#x2019;t German.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; I croaked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good afternoon,&#x201d; the accented voice corrected me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, is it that late?&#x201d; I asked, putting as much innocence into my voice as I could. &#x201c;I must have overslept. What time is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s half past four, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, great,&#x201d; I said, hoping to make this appear in accordance with my plans. Sounding as reasonable as I could, I continued. &#x201c;What day of the week is it? I&#x2019;ve forgotten.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Friday, sir,&#x201d; the voice on the phone said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; I hadn&#x2019;t misplaced an entire day. But I still didn&#x2019;t know where I was. &#x201c;Um, I&#x2019;m just writing a postcard,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;Could you remind me again of the name of the hotel?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hotel L&#x2019;Europe, sir,&#x201d; the voice on the phone said without hesitation.<br> <br>This didn&#x2019;t help to determine my location either. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know if you...</p><h2>Jason and the Argonauts: The First Great Quest in Greek Mythology</h2><p><b>A beautifully illustrated account of the Greek myth of Jason and the Argonauts with informative details from the award-winning author of <i>Electric Ben</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> The story of Jason and the Argonauts is one of the earliest recorded Greek myths.

She made John Lennon blush and Marlon Brando clam up. She cold-shouldered Princess Diana and humiliated Elizabeth Taylor. Andy Warhol photographed her. Jack Nicholson offered her cocaine. Gore Vidal revered her. John Fowles hoped to keep her as his sex-slave. Dudley Moore propositioned her. Francis Bacon heckled her. Peter Sellers was in love with her. For Pablo Picasso, she was the object of sexual fantasy. &#34;If they knew what I had done in my dreams with your royal ladies&#34; he confided to a friend, &#34;they would take me to the Tower of London and chop off my head!&#34; Princess Margaret aroused passion and indignation in equal measures. To her friends, she was witty and regal. To her enemies, she was rude and demanding. In her 1950&#39;s heyday, she was seen as one of the most glamorous and desirable women in the world. By the time of her death, she had come to personify disappointment. One friend said he had never known an unhappier woman. The tale of Princess Margaret is pantomime as tragedy, and tragedy as pantomime. It is Cinderella in reverse: hope dashed, happiness mislaid, life mishandled. Combining interviews, parodies, dreams, parallel lives, diaries, announcements, lists, catalogues and essays, Ma&#39;am Darling is a kaleidoscopic experiment in biography, and a witty meditation on fame and art, snobbery and deference, bohemia and high society.</p><p>Craig Brown is the author of 18 books, and a prolific journalist.

Providing almost instant access to space and every corner of the globe using the Black Stallion spaceplanes, the ABF's powerful network of satellites and unmanned aircraft controlled from space can not only attack any target anywhere on the planet within hours but can even invade any computer network as easily as making a phone call.</p><p>But the program has its critics and doomsayers, including Russia, the United Nations, and the American press. Wealthy, Western-educated, and sophisticated Russian president Leonid Zevitin uses a combination of top-secret anti-spacecraft weaponry, fearmongering, and new U.S. president Joseph Gardner's own egotism in an effective plan to eliminate all support for the space program. Gardner and his allies in Congress and the Pentagon will stop at nothing&#x2014;even destroying one of their own&#x2014;to get what they want.</p><p>Yet McLanahan and his forces refuse to allow the Russian aggression to stand. McLanahan ignores directives from the White House and Pentagon to stand down and orders the ABF to attack secret Russian bases in Iran. </p><p>President Gardner orders McLanahan's immediate arrest. But before authorities can throw him in jail, they have to figure out how to retrieve him from the space base orbiting the earth. Currently in control of the Aerospace Battle Force from Armstrong Space Station, McLanahan closely watches Russia's movement of weaponry while defending himself against the President's attempts to discredit him. In a race against time, McLanahan must outmaneuver his own countrymen, defeat the Russians, and expose the truth . . . or die trying.</p></p><p><p>Former U.S. Air Force captain Dale Brown is the superstar author of 26 best-selling action-adventure &#x201c;techno-thriller&#x201d; novels: FLIGHT OF THE OLD DOG (1987), SILVER TOWER (1988), DAY OF THE CHEETAH (1989), HAMMERHEADS (1990), SKY MASTERS (1991), NIGHT OF THE HAWK (1992), CHAINS OF COMMAND (1993), STORMING HEAVEN (1994), SHADOWS OF STEEL (1996), FATAL TERRAIN (1997), THE TIN MAN (1998), BATTLE BORN, (1999), WARRIOR CLASS (2001), WINGS OF FIRE (2002), AIR BATTLE FORCE (2003), PLAN OF ATTACK (2004), ACT OF WAR (2005), EDGE OF BATTLE (2006), STRIKE FORCE (2007), SHADOW COMMAND (2008), ROGUE FORCES (2009), EXECUTIVE INTENT (2010), A TIME FOR PATRIOTS (2011), TIGER&#x2019;S CLAW (2012), STARFIRE (2014), and IRON WOLF (2015).

In 2009, Lieutenant General McLanahan, commander of the High Technology Aerospace Weapons Center, fears the Russians are covertly arming Iran, now known as the Democratic Republic of Persia. An immoral and weak U.S. president, Joseph Gardner, doesn't help the situation. Full of technical prose (Skybolt was powered by a MHDG, or magnetohydrodynamic generator, which used two small nuclear reactors to rapidly shoot a slug of molten metal back and forth through a magnetic field to produce the enormous amount of power required by the laser) and broadly drawn characters, from Gardner, who can't keep his pants on even during a global crisis, to Senate majority leader Stacy Anne Barbeau, who wields her cleavage in the interests of her constituents as well as national security, this novel will appeal to readers who care more about advanced weaponry than a plausible plot. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He knew <i>no one</i> and <i>nothing</i> about standup comedy, but he was determined to go for it anyway.<br> <br> At forty-four, he&#x2019;s on the <i>Forbes</i>&#x2019; list of highest earning comedians, sells out arenas, and has starred in four hit comedy specials including <i>Why Would You Do That? </i>on Showtime.<br> <br> <i>Stay Hungry </i>tells the story of the twenty years in between. On the way from clueless rube to standup superstar, Seb was booed off stages; survived on tips and stolen food; got advice from mentors Andrew Dice Clay, Vince Vaughn, Tony Danza, and Jerry Seinfeld; fell in love; and stayed true to his Italian-immigrant roots. The one code that always kept him going: stay hungry, keep focused, never give up, and one day, you&#x2019;ll make it.</p><p>Sebastian Maniscalco is a stand-up comedian, actor, and podcast host. In 2016 he was named Just for Laughs' Stand-Up Comedian of the Year and released his third Showtime special <i>Why Would You Do That?</i>, the network&#x2019;s most successful comedy/variety special premiere. In 2017 his success globally landed him on <i>Forbes</i>&#x2019; &#x201c;The World&#x2019;s Highest Paid Comedians&#x201d; list while his major motion picture portfolio expanded to include a voice-over for character Johnny the Groundhog in the animated feature <i>Nut Job 2</i> and appearances in films including the Will Ferrell-starring New Line Feature comedy <i>The House </i>and a role in 2018&#x2019;s <i>Tag</i>, starring alongside Ed Helms and Jeremy Renner. Maniscalco is currently the co-host of SiriusXM&#x2019;s popular<i> The Pete and Sebastian Show</i>. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife Lana and daughter Serafina.Even though Sebastian says that "comedy can't be learned, it is an experience you must endure," there's an awful lot to learn in this book. Not only for comics but for all performers. A really good read from beginning to end and some laughs along the way.

His teaching and writings have inspired a generation&#x2019;s thinking about humankind&#x2019;s place in the Earth Community and the universe, engendering widespread critical acclaim and a documentary film on his life and work.<br> This new collection of essays, from various years and occasions, expands and deepens ideas articulated in his earlier writings and also breaks new ground. Berry opens our eyes to the full dimensions of the ecological crisis, framing it as a crisis of spiritual vision. Applying his formidable erudition in cultural history, science, and comparative religions, he forges a compelling narrative of creation and communion that reconciles modern evolutionary thinking and traditional religious insights concerning our integral role in Earth&#x2019;s society.<br>While sounding an urgent alarm at our current dilemma, Berry inspires us to reclaim our role as the consciousness of the universe and thereby begin to create a true partnership with the Earth Community. With <i>Evening Thoughts</i>, this wise elder has lit another beacon to lead us home.</p><p><b>Thomas Berry</b> (1914-2009), one of the leading environmental thinkers in North America, was the director of the Riverdale Center for Religious Research and founder of the History of Religions Program at Fordham University.

According to cultural historian Berry, our immediate danger is not nuclear war but industrial plundering; our entire society, he argues, is trapped in a closed cycle of production and consumption. Berry points out that our perception of the earth is the product of cultural conditioning, and that most of us fail to think of ourselves as a species but rather as national, ethnic, religious or economic groups. Describing education as "a process of cultural coding somewhat parallel to genetic coding," he proposes a curriculum based on awareness of the earth. He discusses "patriarchy" as a new interpretation of Western historical development, naming four patriachies that have controlled Western history, becoming progressively destructive: the classical empires, the ecclesiastical establishment, the nation-state and the modern corporation. We must reject partial solutions and embrace profound changes toward a "biocracy" that will heal the earth, urges the author who defines problems and causes with eloquence. <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> With this classic book, Thomas Berry broke crucial new ground in the human relationship with the planet.

I read the message again. The order was clear and concise. <em>Return to the Citadel immediately and report directly to the Council Hall. </em>The signatures of the entire Sitian Council and all three Master Magicians were scrawled under the missive. A bit heavy-handed, but I couldn't miss the importance nor doubt the seriousness.<br><br>"What does it say?" Janco asked. He plucked the paper from my fingers, scanned the short note and whistled. "This is major." Scratching the scar where the lower half of his right ear used to be, Janco squinted at me in concern. "You're not going to obey are you? 'Cause, if you do&#x2014;"<br><br>"I know." No need to state the obvious.<br><br>"The Council will escort you straight to the Keep's dungeons where you will stay for a very, very long time," Devlen said in a matter-of-fact tone.<br><br>I glared at him.<br><br>"Did I say you can talk?" Janco asked him.<br><br>"I am trying to help," he replied, shrugging. His cloak covered his hands, which had been manacled behind his back.<br><br>"I don't want <em>your </em>help," I said.<br><br>Devlen opened his mouth, and Janco jabbed him in his solar plexus. As Devlen gasped to regain his breath, Janco threatened to yank out his tongue if he uttered another word.<br><br>We all knew it was an empty threat. Traveling with Janco, Devlen and two Ixian guards for the past twenty days had become an exercise in patience for me. Since Devlen's soul was currently living inside Ulrick's body due to a twist of blood magic, Devlen knew Janco couldn't harm him, so he needled Janco whenever possible.<br><br>We planned to escort Devlen to Moon Clan's lands in order to find his body with Ulrick's soul, and then have the Soul-finder Yelena switch them back. I had sent a message detailing this plan to Second Magician Zitora Cowan as soon as we reached the Sitian border.<br><br>"Opal," Janco said. "We need a decision. It's getting dark."<br><br>"Give me a minute." I drew in a deep breath. The Council wanted me to return. My new powers terrified them, and me, too, if I thought about it for long. The Council had an excellent reason to be nervous and want me safely contained. I could drain a magician of his or her powers. All I needed was a glass orb in my hands and I could extract their magic, transforming it into a physical substance&#x2014;diamonds. A magician didn't even have to attack me as I had first assumed. Oh no, I could milk a magician dry without them doing a thing.<br><br>The Council's messenger hadn't waited around for a response. No one disobeyed a direct order from the Council. Certainly not a student glass magician who hadn't even graduated from the Keep yet.<br><br>"Well?" Janco asked with impatience.<br><br>Finding Ulrick was more important, and putting a stop to blood magic was vital. "We'll make a detour to Fulgor first. I'll send Zitora a message. She'll understand." I hoped.<br><br>However, my plans didn't go the way I had envisioned. Nope.<br><br>No warning bells or strange portents would alert me that by the next day Devlen and I would be in the exact opposite positions.<br><br>Unaware of the coming storm, I ignored the Council's message. We hiked east through a thin forest. Dead leaves crunched under our boots. The cold season had stripped the trees and bushes, leaving behind bare branches. The warming season had started a few days ago, and the frozen ground had turned into a muddy mess as we traveled farther south. Glancing over my shoulder, I noted the beauty of the stark and simple woods against the wide swaths of colors in the sky. The cool air smelled damp and fresh.<br><br>"Should we make camp before it gets dark?" Janco asked.<br><br>This section of Sitia seemed familiar to me, and my stomach knotted as I remembered when I'd been here before.<br><br>"Is your cabin nearby?" I asked Devlen.<br><br>"I was wondering if you recognized the area," he said with a faint smile. "The good old days."<br><br>I bit my lip to keep from contradicting him. When he wasn't trying to play with my mind and emotions, he enjoyed irritating me, too. For example, he had lapsed back into the Daviian pattern of speech instead of trying to mimic Ulrick. "How close?"<br><br>Devlen scanned the woods and met my gaze. An odd sensation rippled through me. Seeing his cold calculation in Ulrick's vibrant green eyes still unsettled me. Ulrick's long eyelashes, black hair and sharp features all remained, but I longed for Ulrick's tender smile.<br><br>"Quite close. Are you sure you want to go there?" Devlen asked.<br><br>I considered. "Better than spending another night in the open. Take the lead."<br><br>He led us to a small one-story cabin as all light fled the sky. Janco lit a fire in the hearth, then unpacked our travel rations.<br><br>"It's too dark to hunt. I'll search for a few rabbits in the morning." He placed a pot of water on the fire to cook his road stew.<br><br>At first, the ad hoc concoction of Janco's had tasted wonderful, but after twenty days, I longed for my mother's apple cobbler and bread pudding. Her roast pork alone would be worth the five-day journey to Booruby Homesickness and loneliness stabbed my chest. My parents must have been distraught when they learned of my disappearance. Despite knowing my mother would fuss over me and admonish me for hours, I longed for home.<br><br>As Janco stirred the stew, the two guards took turns bringing in more firewood. I grabbed a branch and made a torch. Devlen watched me. He had been manacled to the support beam in the living room. Last time we were here, I had been Devlen's prisoner.<br><br>I stepped into the kitchen to search for food, but the few scraps of bread and cheese had spoiled. Crossing the living room to check the bedrooms, I trod on glass shards, the <em>crackle-crunch </em>under my boots unmistakable.<br><br>"I did not get a chance to clean up," Devlen called.<br><br>I crouched. The shards reflected the torchlight. It had been one of the glass orbs the Stormdancers used to harvest a storm's energy. Another pang of loneliness touched me. Kade had remained behind in Ixia to calm the lethal blizzards blowing in from the northern ice sheet. Kade would fill a number of orbs with the killing wind's energy and save many lives. I closed my eyes, remembering his goodbye kiss. I would forgo my mother's cooking for another moment wrapped in his long, lean arms.<br><br>Janco announced the stew was ready. I opened my eyes and straightened. My saddlebags remained where Devlen had tossed them in the corner with my sais still hooked onto them. Grabbing them, I returned to the fire, sitting down next to Janco.<br><br>Devlen groaned. "I should have hidden those."<br><br>Janco perked up, peering over his bowl. "What ja got?"<br><br>"My sais." I hefted the weapons. One in each hand. They looked like short swords except the main shaft was a half-inch thick and octagonal. A weighted octagonal knob at the top balanced the sai. It resembled a three-pronged pitchfork with a long center tine.<br><br>I held them in a defensive position. The metal shaft rested along my forearm. From this position I could block a strike, jab an opponent with the knob or switch my grip and do a temple strike with the shaft.<br><br>"Sweet," Janco said. "Can I try?"<br><br>I showed him a few moves and he was proficient in no time.<br><br>"These don't have the reach of a bow staff or sword, more of a defensive weapon. But in close..." He jabbed with both sais as if aiming at an invisible opponent's ribs. The weapons blurred with the motion. "In close, you have it made. I'm gonna get me a pair. A Sitian souvenir."<br><br>"She does not need to get close or even use those at all," Devlen said. "Not with the other goodies in her bags."<br><br>Janco stopped his attack and looked at me as if waiting for a treat. "Well? Spill."<br><br>I unbuckled the flaps and upended the contents onto the wooden floor. Glass spiders and bees rained out in a loud clatter. Janco exchanged the sais for one of the brown spiders. He examined it in the firelight.<br><br>"Trapping Warpers not enough? Have you moved on to trapping spiders now?" Janco asked.<br><br>"No. Tricky had attacked me with a magical illusion of big spiders. When I channeled his magic into the orb they transformed into glass." I suppressed a shudder. Those creatures had been a foot long.<br><br>"Why didn't they turn into diamonds?"<br><br>"He directed his magic at her in the form of spiders," Devlen said. "The magic only transforms into diamonds when she <em>steals </em>it." Anger fueled his words.<br><br>"From what you did with your magic, I don't blame her." Janco exchanged the spider for a glass bee. "In fact, I'd rather she steal everyone's magic. No power over another's mind. No stealing souls. No crazy or weird stuff. Diamonds are much better." He held the bee up to the firelight. The green-and-black stripes glowed. "Pretty."<br><br>I shivered. "Pretty scary. They're Greenblade bees. Their six-inch-long bodies are filled with lethal venom. Only I can crack open the glass and release the bee. One sting and you're dead."<br><br>"Cool." Janco's eyes lit with admiration.<br><br>Interesting how he could appreciate the killing power of a bee, yet he despised magical powers. I wondered if I should point out the inconsistency until I remembered Janco could argue about any point, logical or not. I would get an hour-long lecture on how everyone knows bees sting, but a magician could hide their lethality until too late.<br><br>The next morning we resumed our journey. I planned to find a town in order to rent or purchase horses, but didn't know the surrounding area well enough. Unfortunately, Devlen was well acquainted. I hated to ask him for help, but the Council wouldn't hesitate to send a retrieval party once they figured out I disobeyed their summons.<br><br>"Do you know where the closest town is?" I asked Devlen.<br><br>"Why should I help you?"<br><br>"Do you want to walk all the way to Fulgor?"<br><br>"I do not mind. I enjoy your company. The longer it takes for us to get there, the more time I can spend with you."<br><br>"Watch it," Janco warned.<br><br>"How about I make a deal with you?" Devlen stepped closer.<br><br>My legs wanted to step back, but I held my ground. "You don't have anything to bargain with. We can just head east until we find one. Otherwise there's a good stable in Owl's Hill."<br><br>"You do not want to get that close to the Citadel and Magician's Keep." He shook his head. "I do have something to bargain with."<br><br>Unlikely but I gestured for him to continue.<br><br>"Quartz and Moonlight." He watched my reaction and smiled.<br><br>"Who are they?" Janco asked.<br><br>"Mine and Ulrick's horses." And I missed Quartz almost as much as I missed Kade.<br><br>"I'll lead you to them and in exchange&#x2014;"<br><br>"No way," Janco said.<br><br>"Let him finish," I said. And when the Ixian frowned at me, I added, "Please. They're Sandseed horses."<br><br>He nodded, but his expression made it clear to me he was unhappy.<br><br>"In exchange, I want you to remove the manacles."<br><br>"No way," Janco and I said together.<br><br>"I promise not to run. I have been cooperating with you the entire trip."<br><br>"You've been a pain in the ass the entire trip," Janco said. "I'm sure given the first opportunity you'd bolt."<br><br>"And I can't trust you at all," I said. "There is no reason for you to keep your promise."<br><br>Devlen sighed. "You know why I would not, Opal. Just look past the whole kidnapping thing and remember how you felt when we were together."<br><br>"The whole kidnapping thing? <em>You </em>might be able to dismiss it out of hand, but, to <em>me, </em>it's too big to look past."<br><br>"You just want to deny you loved me."<br><br>"I cared for <em>Ulrick, </em>whose body you stole. Not you!"<br><br>"Come on. You had to know I was not Ulrick. No one changes that much."<br><br>I almost laughed. He had done it again. Played with my emotions. It was like arguing with Janco&#x2014;a no-win situation. Devlen had been trying to trick me into saying I had fallen for him well aware on some unconscious level of who he was.<br><br>The real reason he wanted me close was for the chance to reclaim his magical abilities with blood magic. The same illegal powers that Devlen had used to switch souls with Ulrick in the first place.<br><br>"Okay. Fine. Keep lying to yourself. I will take you to the horses anyway." Devlen led us to a large horse farm a few miles north of Robin's Nest in the Featherstone lands.<br><br>Peter Featherstone, the stable's owner, showed us to the pasture. Moonlight's mostly black coat stood out among the other horses. He nickered and ran to the fence with Quartz on his heels. Happy to see her, I threw my arms around Quartz's neck and hugged her. When she pulled away in impatience, I inspected her from nose to tail. Her reddish-brown and white coat gleamed. No mud or cuts marred her legs and her mane and tail had been combed free of briars and straw. Her hooves were trimmed and neat. No horseshoes, though. Sandseed horses won't let a farrier near them.<br><br>She nudged me with her nose, searching for treats. The only white on her brown face was a patch between her eyes. I probably imagined the sympathetic look she gave me, suppressing the sudden desire to pour my heart out to her.<br><br>I checked Moonlight. His sleek muscles enhanced his powerful build and he appeared healthy, too. The only white on him&#x2014;the circle on his forehead and the reason for his name&#x2014;shone as if recently washed.<br><br>"No doubt they're yours," Peter said.<br><br>"What do I owe you for their care?" I asked.<br><br>He looked at Devlen in surprise. "Nothing. He paid for two full seasons. In fact, I owe you."<br><br>"Perhaps we can work out a deal. I need three more horses."<br><br>"They won't be Sandseed horses. They're too expensive. It's been my pleasure to take care of these two. I've never seen such intelligence." Peter led us to the main stable.<br><br>The large wooden building smelled of earth and horses. Sawdust littered the floor and dust motes floated in the sunlight streaming through the big open doors. Two rows of stalls, sitting back-to-back, lined each side, creating three walkways. The main throughway was wider than the others. Ropes hung along the stalls to secure horses for grooming and saddling.<br><br>"Your tack is in the back room." He pointed. "I'll have my staff bring your horses and the rental horses. See what you think of them." He hustled back to the pasture.<br><br>I entered the tack room. My saddle hung on the far wall and I unhooked it. The leather had been cleaned. In fact, the bridles, reins and rest of our tack appeared to be in good condition. The neat and organized room reflected Peter's caring and professional attitude.<br><br>Which was why the crack of a whip surprised me so much. Laden with equipment, I hurried from the room.<br><br></p><h2>Myth-Nomers and Im-Pervections (M.Y.T.H., Bk. 8)</h2><p>How could a thick-headed demon be so thin-skinned?

You gotta grab it by the balls while you still can, enjoy those little moments of pleasure.<br>You know the moments I mean. Whether you&#x2019;re drop-kicking the butt of some tango who&#x2019;s dreaming of paradise while fondling his suicide vest, or maybe reaming a new orifice for a C21&nbsp;officer, you have to make the most of the opportunity. Savor it. Life just doesn&#x2019;t contain that many moments of personal triumph.<br>But there are also moments when you have to relax and just let life flow by.<br>Like, for instance, when you&#x2019;re hurtling over the countryside in an Mi-8TV/India helicopter so close to the ground that the crew chief&#x2019;s spit can rebound off a rock and hit the pilot in the face.<br>Those tracers in the distance?<br>Nothing to worry about. They&#x2019;re not even firing in your direction. Yet.<br>The surface-to-air missile battery looming to the right?<br>What&#x2019;s the fuss? That&#x2019;s designed to shoot down airplanes, not helicopters.<br>The fact that you&#x2019;re flying over the disputed area of Kashmir, across one of the most volatile borders in the world?<br>Certainly a plus.<br>You don&#x2019;t think?<br>Then maybe it&#x2019;s a good thing you weren&#x2019;t with us.<br>But truth be told, I couldn&#x2019;t have been more relaxed if I was back at Rogue Manor, sipping a medicinal Sapphire prescribed by the good Dr. Bombay himself.<br>There were plenty of reasons to relax. For one thing, I had no direct role in the operation. On paper at least. I was just there to observe, a guest of the Indian government.<br>Of course, we weren&#x2019;t in India at the time, but I&#x2019;m never one to stand on technicalities. I was certainly ready to observe&nbsp;&#x2014; watching the bullets fly out of my MP5 counts, right?<br>So why shouldn&#x2019;t I relax and let the helo toss me around a bit?<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>This would normally be the part where I&#x2019;d explain what the hell I was doing in Kashmir. But my editor likes it when I get right to the action, so we&#x2019;ll save the explanation for a little later.<br>For now, let&#x2019;s just say I wasn&#x2019;t in Kashmir, or India for that matter, to knit sweaters.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>The helo banked into a sharp turn to tuck around the mountain. Treetops scraped the undercarriage, tussling it a bit before letting go. Our Mi-8TV/India was a special demonstration version of the Russian Mi-8TV, which itself is a souped-up Mi-17 with guns, missiles, and assorted nasty shit designed to complicate the enemy&#x2019;s day. You can think of it as Russia&#x2019;s answer to the MH-60DAP, the armed Blackhawk hand-built to ferry spec op troops deep behind the bad guys&#x2019; lines (DAP = Deep Armed Penetrator, or some vulgar variation thereof).<br>The Indians had recently purchased several Mi-17s and were reviewing the Mi-8TV/India as part of their plans to upgrade their military. Helicopters have a problem flying at high altitude, which can be a problem in the Himalayas, since even when you&#x2019;re low there you&#x2019;re pretty high. Kashmir ain&#x2019;t the Himalayas, but some of the&nbsp;<i>valleys</i>&nbsp;there clock in at five thousand feet, so it ain&#x2019;t low either. I&#x2019;m happy to say the Mi-8TV was doing fine. Better than my stomach, even.<br>I&#x2019;d mentioned tracers.<br>These were actually not being fired at us, even though they were in the general vicinity. They were part of a training exercise being conducted by the Indian army close to the border of the disputed area it shares, or rather doesn&#x2019;t share, with Pakistan. Kashmir-Jammu is claimed by both Pakistan and India, and occupied by both&nbsp;... and China. Just to keep things interesting.<br>China?<br>That&#x2019;s right. China controls about twenty percent of the historical demarcation of the region claimed by India. That&#x2019;s not quite as much as Pakistan, which I believe has between thirty-five and thirty-nine, but it&#x2019;s more than enough to keep things interesting.<br>(And complicated. The State Department used to have some good backgrounders available to the public, but you won&#x2019;t find them online anymore, at least not unless you have my intel and computer geek Shunt&#x2019;s skills. If you care for a book, Victoria Schofield&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Kashmir in Conflict</i>&nbsp;is among the better choices.)<br>Pakistan and India aren&#x2019;t at war right now, but tensions are always high between the two countries. Both armies have been known to hold maneuvers on their respective sides of the line, partly to keep their troops sharp, partly to show the other side they&#x2019;re not taking guff, and partly just because.<br>Tonight&#x2019;s action was none of the above. The maneuvers, with live ammo, were being staged to draw the Pakistan army&#x2019;s attention away from our little op. While all eyes were focused on the border area, we were dropping in on a little schoolyard roughly fifty miles behind the Pakistani lines.<br>Generally when you&#x2019;re a passenger in a helicopter, you don&#x2019;t measure distance in miles, or kilometers for that matter. You measure it in time and stomach acid.<br>It took us roughly fifteen minutes and two Maalox moments before we cleared the mountain and slid down into the valley that ran up toward our destination. It was a long fifteen minutes. Every one of the fifteen people aboard, including yours truly, felt their intestines steadily tighten with every minute that passed.<br>Save one.<br>That exception was Shotgun, aka Paul &#x201c;Shotgun&#x201d; Fox, one of my young bucks who was shadowing me on the mission. Besides his mandatory Twinkies and a slightly crushed package of Drake&#x2019;s cakes, Shotgun had brought along a huge bag of peanuts for the mission. He ate them the entire time we flew, cracking each with his fingers, pinching the nuts into his mouth, then tossing the shells on the floor. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever been in a helicopter that smelled just-roasted before.<br>One that wasn&#x2019;t on fire, I mean.<br>I have no idea how he managed to eat them. In my mind, you can&#x2019;t eat peanuts without a cold beer to savor the flavor.<br>None of the Indians we were with complained. It wasn&#x2019;t surprising. Shotgun stands maybe six-eight in his bare feet. He weighs three hundred pounds, give or take a side of roast beef or two. Which he&#x2019;d had a particular hankering for ever since we came to India.<br>Not to give you the impression that the Indians we were with were small guys, much less that they were wimps. On the contrary. We were observing the inaugural mission of India&#x2019;s Special Squadron Zero&nbsp;&#x2014; the rough Indian equivalent of my old Red Cell outfit. And they were about to take action against a terrorist cell that was using Pakistan as a safe haven.<br>Our target had once been a small farm on the outskirts of a village I&#x2019;ll call Heartburnville. I&#x2019;m using a fake name because the village was not affiliated with the terrorists, and in fact was exploited by them. The tangos would go into town and take what they wanted from the stores without paying&nbsp;&#x2014; not usual tango practice, I might note, and a real mistake in this case, since it stirred up feelings against them. At the time, I thought this had helped lead to our receiving the intelligence on their plans. That little ass-u-me assumption proved incorrect.<br>But I&#x2019;m getting ahead of the story.<br>The helo took one last hard bank and pitched forward, pirouetting into a small field at the base of a hill. &#x201c;Go! Go! Go!&#x201d; yelled the team sergeant, urging the men out of the chopper.<br>The sergeant was Sanjin Phurem, a fortyish army noncom who&#x2019;d served in Kashmir before being assigned somewhere in southern India. Like everyone else in Special Squadron Zero, he was a volunteer.<br>Shotgun and I followed the Indians out. There was just enough moonlight to see the rocks that littered the field. I moved to my left, looking for the unit&#x2019;s commander, Captain Dyas Birla.<br>Birla was an Indian naval officer who had been part of Marcos&nbsp;&#x2014; the Indian Marine Commando Force or MCF as it&#x2019;s often called in India. You can think of MCF as a marine recon unit with SEAL aspirations. His skills were more administrative and political than actually combat-related, an unfortunate by-product of the Indian military system. Still, he did lead from the front, the number one characteristic you need in a special warfare officer.<br>&#x201c;Good so far, yes, Commander Rick?&#x201d; he asked as I ran up.<br>I&#x2019;m not sure exactly why or when he had decided to give me the title&nbsp;&#x2014; he must have skimmed my first book,2&nbsp;stopping about midway, then put three and two together&nbsp;&#x2014; but he meant it as a compliment, so I grunted. Things&nbsp;<i>were</i>&nbsp;looking decent, but we had a bit of a walk ahead of us&nbsp;&#x2014; so as not to attract too much attention, the helo had dropped us a little more than three miles from the actual target. The chopper&#x2019;s muffled engines would have been almost impossible for anyone there to hear.<br>&#x201c;We will commence our operation at exactly 0300,&#x201d; Captain Birla told his men as they set out. &#x201c;We will observe strict radio silence until this point, unless there is the necessity of communication.&#x201d;<br>That gave us two hours to walk exactly 3.2 miles, or 5.15 kilometers. Piece of cake.<br>Shotgun smirked at me.<br>&#x201c;No communication until Murphy steps in,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Murphy doesn&#x2019;t use a radio,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s everywhere.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Kind of like Santa Claus,&#x201d; said Shotgun. &#x201c;Or the Good Humor man. Want some peanuts?&#x201d;<br>I shook my head and started walking. Shotgun&#x2019;s reference set is a little different from most normal human beings.<br>Roughly an hour later, we arrived at the fence of a madrassa&nbsp;&#x2014; or &#x201c;a Muslim school, college, or university that is often part of a mosque&#x201d; as Webster succinctly puts it in his...</p><h2>The Anatomy of Hope: How People Prevail in the Face of Illness</h2><p>An inspiring and profoundly enlightening exploration of one doctor&#x2019;s discovery of how hope can change<br>the course of illness<br><br>Since the time of the ancient Greeks, human beings have believed that hope is essential to life. Now, in this groundbreaking book, Harvard Medical School professor and<i> New Yorker</i> staff writer Jerome Groopman shows us why.<br><br>The search for hope is most urgent at the patient&#x2019;s bedside.<b> The Anatomy of Hope</b> takes us there, bringing us into the lives of people at pivotal moments when they reach for and find hope--or when it eludes their grasp.

Her patient is the artist Henri Matisse, and as Matisse recovers from his illness, he and Monique become good friends. Later, Monique enters a convent where she becomes a nursing nun--and by happy coincidence, she meets Matisse once again. Her religious order is so poor that they don&#39;t have a chapel of their own, but Matisse decides that with Monique&#39;s help, he can remedy that situation. He develops a sketch drawn by Monique into a brilliant set of stained-glass chapel windows, and then uses his influence to raise enough money for the chapel&#39;s construction. This true account of Matisse and the chapel at Vence, in southern France, is the main focus of Laurence Anholt&#39;s newest delightful children&#39;s story. Anholt&#39;s illustrations faithfully reproduce many of Matisse&#39;s wonderful artworks in this beautiful storybook.</p><p>(back cover) <br> When Monique, a young visiting nurse, steps into the home of an elderly patient, she finds herself in rooms filled with the most vivid colors she has ever seen.

These women had spent their entire adult lives embroiled in political struggles: protesting the Vietnam War, fighting for black and Native American liberation, and confronting US imperialism. They created a new organization to wage their war: The May 19th Communist Organization, or &#x201c;M19,&#x201d; a name derived from the birthday shared by Malcolm X and Ho Chi Minh, two of their revolutionary idols. Together, these six women carried out some of the most daring operations in the history of domestic terrorism&#x2014;from prison breakouts and murderous armed robberies, to a bombing campaign that wreaked havoc on the nation&#x2019;s capital. Three decades later, M19&#x2019;s actions and shocking tactics still reverberate for many reasons, but one truly sets them apart: unlike any other American terrorist group before or since, M19 was created and led by women.<br> <br><i>Tonight We Bombed the US Capitol</i> tells the full story of M19 for the first time, alongside original photos and declassified FBI documents. Through the group&#x2019;s history, intelligence and counterterrorism expert William Rosenau helps us understand how homegrown extremism&#x2014;a threat that still looms over us today&#x2014;is born.</p><p>William Rosenau, PhD, is a senior research scientist and has also worked as a political scientist at RAND, as a counterterrorism adviser at the State Department, and as a staffer on a US Senate terrorism subcommittee.

The closest thing to a formal beginning was a fiery manifesto the nascent group issued in 1979: &#x201c;The Principles of Unity of the May 19th Communist Organization.&#x201d; Their creed was &#x201c;revolutionary anti-imperialism,&#x201d; and like other millenarians, they wrapped their faith in reason. &#x201c;Our science is Marxism-Leninism,&#x201d; they wrote.2<br> <br>The United States, according to May 19th, was the ultimate &#x201c;white oppressor nation,&#x201d; a &#x201c;parasite on the Third World,&#x201d; a poisonous spider at the center of a noxious global web.<br> <br>May 19th believed that national liberation wasn&#x2019;t just an international challenge: the United States had its own internal colonies filled with blacks, American Indians, and Puerto Ricans, who were just as ruthlessly exploited as the denizens of any sweltering tropical dictatorship. And it wasn&#x2019;t just racial minorities who were subjugated. The oppression of women in general, and lesbians in particular, was another symptom of a national sickness. Imperialism, capitalism, and racism were strong, but still, May 19th saw some hopeful signs. They heard revolutionary rumblings inside the guts of the American monster and detected systemic weaknesses that were ready to be exploited.<br> <br>May 19th insisted that the &#x201c;oppressed nations within the U.S. are preparing themselves to wage a full-scale people&#x2019;s war against the enemy that has entered its final decline.&#x201d;3 The women offered apocalyptic visions and end-time prophesies: a &#x201c;much more brutal fascist regime,&#x201d; the liberation of captive peoples, and the destruction of the United States.4<br> <br>How could their tiny band of middle-class intellectuals contribute to the global struggle, and bend the arc of history to speed up the destruction of the &#x201c;parasite&#x201d; nation? One of their lawyers later described the women as &#x201c;Revolutionaries. Dreamers. Lovers of Freedom. . . . Some are lesbians. All love women, people fighting everywhere for self-determination and dignity.&#x201d;5<br> <br>But ushering in the new world required more than just good intentions and beautiful dreams. Mao Zedong had made that point back in 1927 when the Chinese Communist Party had been fighting for power. The revolution, Mao said, &#x201c;is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another.&#x201d;6<br> <br>According to May 19th&#x2019;s analysis, the ruling class would never give up peacefully, and May 19th, one member said later, wanted to &#x201c;ensure that all the shooting didn&#x2019;t come from one side.&#x201d;7<br> <br>May 19th said that the First World mass movements of the 1960s had taken a wrong turn. Instead of doing all they could to support national liberation struggles in places such as Vietnam, South Africa, and Palestine, sixties radicals thought they were leading a global revolution. May 19th pledged to avoid that mistake. They vowed to shed their &#x201c;white-skin privilege&#x201d; and work as &#x201c;North American anti-imperialists&#x201d; under the leadership of black and brown people. &#x201c;We, white women, say NO to amerika where white is a badge of acceptance of daily murder,&#x201d; they declared.8<br> <br>May 19th didn&#x2019;t immediately reach for bombs and guns. They started off with nonviolent agitation and propaganda: demonstrations, picketing, speeches, film screenings, and politically informed graphic art. May 19th had a number of affiliated groups that promoted its agenda and served as recruitment pools.I The all-women Madame Binh Graphics Collective pumped out propaganda posters. Other affiliated groups raised funds for Robert Mugabe&#x2019;s wing of the Zimbabwe African National Union, a guerrilla movement fighting to end white minority rule in Rhodesia. They raised hell about imprisoned Puerto Ricans they called &#x201c;freedom fighters.&#x201d; There was an &#x201c;everlasting spiral of activity, urgency, and exhaustion,&#x201d; former May 19th member Mary Patten recalled.9<br> <br>Two women were the heart and soul of the new formation. Although a decade apart in age, they had much in common: a solidly middle-class New York upbringing, early ideological commitment, education at elite institutions&#x2014;and an unwavering dedication to revolution, new values, and sexual self-actualization. Judy and Susan: sisters in arms.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Judith Alice Clark was born to Joseph and Ruth Clark in New York on November 23, 1949. She described her childhood as happy, but it was an unusual upbringing, at least in her early years.<br> <br>As a young man in Brooklyn, Joe had been a member of a Marxist-Leninist microsect that had followed the Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky into anti-Stalinism.<br> <br>Later, Joe concluded that Trotsky and his worshippers had been all wrong. Comrade Joseph Stalin, not Trotsky, was the true communist godhead. Joe switched sides and joined the Moscow-dominated Communist Party USA. He rose quickly through the Party&#x2019;s ranks, and before long he was a full-time high-level Party functionary, and an editor of the Party&#x2019;s newspaper, the Daily Worker.<br> <br>Unsurprisingly, FBI Red hunters kept tabs on the Clarks. They had a sense they were being watched, but it didn&#x2019;t rattle them&#x2014;they were on the right side of history, after all. Stalin&#x2019;s Soviet Union was their alpha and omega. They were utopians, like Tillie Olsen, a true-believing American poet who wrote in 1934 that the Soviet Union was &#x201c;a heaven . . . brought down to earth in Russia.&#x201d;10<br> <br>In 1950, Joe got to see his revolution&#x2019;s control center firsthand. He moved Ruth, their son, Andrew, and baby Judy to Moscow, where he took up a position as a Daily Worker correspondent. The relocation represented a remarkable devotion to the communist cause, given the harsh conditions that prevailed in the Soviet capital and the anticommunist sentiment that saturated postwar America.<br> <br>After a three-year stint, the Clarks returned to New York, and Joe and Ruth continued their Party work. The family lived in Brooklyn: first in Bensonhurst and then in solidly lower-middle-class Flatbush. In the summer they would often go out to Mohegan Lake in Westchester County, where there was a colony of fellow communists. The folk singer Pete Seeger, a supporter of the Communist Party, made occasional appearances at lakeside hootenannies. Those annual excursions to the cozy summer community reinforced social bonds among Party members&#x2014;being a communist meant total commitment.<br> <br>But by the mid-1950s, Ruth and Joe had growing doubts about the communist cause. Even as pampered guests of the USSR, they had seen the pockmarked face of Stalinism up close. As with many other Party members around the world, the bloody Soviet suppression of a nationwide uprising in Hungary in 1956, and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev&#x2019;s &#x201c;secret&#x201d; speech in 1957 denouncing Stalin&#x2019;s crimes, forced the Clarks to reassess their slavish devotion to Moscow.<br> <br>Ruth&#x2019;s Party-related activities dropped off, and in 1957, Joe finally checked out of the Party. There were repercussions: former comrades denounced him as a &#x201c;deserter&#x201d; and &#x201c;liquidationist,&#x201d;11 and it was tough for him to find work. Being a former Communist Party member, Daily Worker editor, and onetime Moscow resident was not exactly a formula for success in late-1950s America. But he managed to eke out a living at the Direct Mail Envelope Company and then at the American Cancer Society. Ruth helped support the family with odd jobs, including door-to-door interviewing for Trix cereal.<br> <br>Although only a pre-teenager, Judy was developing a political consciousness, and she didn&#x2019;t like her parents&#x2019; growing anticommunism. Weaned on Marxism-Leninism, she was a classic &#x201c;red-diaper baby,&#x201d; who&#x2019;d loved the Party&#x2019;s warm embrace. &#x201c;Until I was about eight years old,&#x201d; she recalled, &#x201c;I had lived in a home and in an extended &#x2018;Party family&#x2019; that encouraged important ideals, like tolerance of diversity in the world; awareness of history, of racism, of other forms of injustice.&#x201d;12 That all got yanked away. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t bear the loss of community and ideology and purposefulness in my life.&#x201d;13<br> <br>According to Judy, Ruth turned rightward, trying to bring the family into the American mainstream. She was &#x201c;getting more and more into wanting her family to be like from Father Knows Best.&#x201d;14 But unlike the stereotypical 1950s mother, Ruth pursued a serious career. By the 1970s, she was a senior executive at Daniel Yankelovich&#x2019;s polling firm and the de facto inventor of the exit poll.15<br> <br>Joe remained a man of the left, a socialist, but a staunch anticommunist and opponent of Stalinism. He was a cofounder of Dissent magazine, a lone voice of democratic socialism in midcentury America. In pungent prose, Joe attacked Stalinism, communism, and Fidel Castro, the tropical Spartacus, whose unfolding revolution in Cuba displayed a &#x201c;distinctive, often mad character.&#x201d;16<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Judy, however, kept the far-left faith. &#x201c;I would be the &#x2018;keeper of the flame&#x2019; in my family,&#x201d; she recalled.17 By the time she was fifteen, she was politically active in her own right: she marched on a Congress of Racial Equality picket line outside a Woolworth&#x2019;s lunch counter in Queens. &#x201c;I was always drawn to the most militant groups,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And if the group I was in wasn&#x2019;t radical enough, I would push at the edge.&#x201d;18<br> <br>Judy attended the academically rigorous Midwood High School in Brooklyn,19 then the University of Chicago, where she joined Students for a Democratic Society. Agitation was part of the on-campus zeitgeist, and in January 1969, she and hundreds of other students occupied an administration building, demanding the rehiring of a sociology professor denied tenure and insisting on a permanent student voice in the faculty-hiring process.<br> <br>The university&#x2019;s president, Edward H. Levi&#x2014;whose diminutive frame, low-key manner, and modest lifestyle belied a formidable persona&#x2014;weighed his options. He could have followed the lead of his Columbia University counterpart, Grayson Kirk, who had faced a similar challenge the year before. Kirk had called in the police, who&#x2019;d kicked out the protestors and restored a semblance of order. But Levi was a shrewder character than Kirk: cops meant cracked skulls, bad press, and more anguish for his beloved university. Levi decided to wait it out, and sure enough, after two weeks, the militants voted to leave the building.<br> <br>After the demonstration, the university disciplinary committee voted to expel forty-two protestors, including Judy. Though she and her father had bitter ideological differences (thirty years later, she wrote that he had subjected her to his &#x201c;fits of fury and political harangues&#x201d;), Joe was a loving man who wanted to help his only daughter.20 He asked Irving Howe, Dissent&#x2019;s coeditor, to reach out to the novelist Saul Bellow, who had deep Chicago ties. Bellow intervened with Levi, asking him to please give the Clark girl a second chance.<br> <br>&#x201c;No. She&#x2019;s a bad one,&#x201d; the university president said.21 Judy was out.<br> <br>No matter. By now she was a self-described revolutionary. &#x201c;I felt that my parents had kind of failed, and so, if they failed, I had to do something different,&#x201d; Judy said in an interview in 2017. &#x201c;I romanticized the revolutions going on around the world, and I sort of felt like I had to show I could do whatever was necessary.&#x201d;22 Including violence.<br> <br>As the Students for a Democratic Society self-destructed, Judy became part of what would become known as the Weather Underground. She lived in a collective of a dozen or so radicals&#x2014;mostly women but led by men&#x2014;and she was an enthusiastic part of violent Weather street actions, including the notorious &#x201c;Days of Rage&#x201d; rampage on the streets of Chicago in 1969. On March 17, 1970, the feds issued a warrant for her arrest. The charge: interstate flight to avoid prosecution for &#x201c;mob action.&#x201d; According to the FBI wanted poster that soon was hanging in post offices around the country, Judy was five feet, three inches tall, with brown hair and brown eyes and a medium build. And she had &#x201c;sparkling eyes,&#x201d; according to one fellow activist&#x2019;s poetic tribute.23<br> <br> <br>Judy Clark: A &#x201c;red-diaper baby&#x201d; who kept the faith<br><br>Judy was on the run until December. Bureau men eventually nabbed her in New York at an Upper East Side movie house, where she was watching Yellow Submarine. She served nine months in the Cook County Jail, and after her release, she moved back in with her parents in Brooklyn.<br> <br>Judy was eager to return to activism. She joined the Women&#x2019;s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell, or WITCH, a loosely connected feminist network founded in 1968 by the writer Robin Morgan and future Weather Underground member Naomi Jaffe. According to WITCH, men as such weren&#x2019;t the enemy. The true evil was late capitalism&#x2014;corporations, consumerism, and commodification&#x2014;as the group explained in a 1968 manifesto:<br> <br>WITCH is a total concept, a new dimension of women. It means breaking the bond of woman as a biologically and sexually defined creature. It implies the destruction of passivity, consumerism and commodity fetishism. . . . Who is the enemy? WITCHes must name names, or rather we must name trademarks and brand names.24<br> <br>WITCH loved to put on a good spectacle&#x2014;one Halloween, thirteen women dressed as witches went to lower Manhattan to &#x201c;hex&#x201d; the temple of modern capital, the New York Stock Exchange. WITCH also conducted what it called &#x201c;invisible actions,&#x201d; such as the ex post facto &#x201c;snuffing out&#x201d; of Lurleen Wallace, the wife of Alabama governor George Wallace, who had succumbed to breast cancer in May 1968.25<br> <br>During the mid-1970s, Judy edited Midnight Special, a publication for convicts sponsored by the far-left National Lawyers Guild. Her readers included Congressman Larry McDonald, a leader of the ultraright John Birch Society known for his fanciful conspiracy mongering, his rabid commitment to fighting communism and subversion, and for his tenuous hold on reality.

In fact, the justice system often increases the injury. Offenders are less ignored by this system, but their real needs&#x2014;for accountability, for closure, for healing&#x2014;are also left unaddressed. Such failures are not accidental, but are inherent in the very definitions and assumptions which govern our thinking about crime and justice. Howard Zehr proposes a "restorative" model which is more consistent with experience, with the past, and with the biblical tradition. Based on the needs of victims and offenders, he takes into account recent studies and biblical principles.

If work is our national religion, Pang is the philosopher reintegrating our bifurcated selves."</b><b>---Arianna Huffington, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>Overwork is the new normal. Rest is something to do when the important things are done-but they are never done. Looking at different forms of rest, from sleep to vacation, Silicon Valley futurist and business consultant Alex Soojung-Kim Pang dispels the myth that the harder we work the better the outcome. He combines rigorous scientific research with a rich array of examples of writers, painters, and thinkers---from Darwin to Stephen King---to challenge our tendency to see work and relaxation as antithetical. "Deliberate rest," as Pang calls it, is the true key to productivity, and will give us more energy, sharper ideas, and a better life. <i>Rest </i>offers a roadmap to rediscovering the importance of rest in our lives, and a convincing argument that we need to relax more if we actually want to get more done.</p><p>I became interested in the importance of rest in creative lives began when I noticed a paradox: many of history's most accomplished thinkers, artists, writers, and composers organized their lives around their work, but not their days. Figures as diverse as Charles Darwin, Salvador Dali, and Maya Angelou think about their work constantly, and achieve much more than most of us, yet they spend fewer hours <b>laboring</b> than we do. What accounts for their success?<br>The key is not the quantity of their work, but the quality of their rest. Many super-creative and -productive people take a distinctive approach to rest.&nbsp;<ul><li>They see rest as a skill: like speaking or running, it's something we all do naturally, and can learn to do better.&nbsp;</li><li>They learn to harness mind-wandering: they develop habits that give their brains a break, or give their unconscious minds time to explore new ideas.&nbsp;</li><li>They treat rest with respect, and make time for it in their daily schedules.&nbsp;</li><li>They recognize rest as a resource that can extend their creative lives.</li></ul><i>Rest</i>&nbsp;blends history, biography, and recent work in neuroscience and psychology to uncover the critical but under-recognized role rest plays in the lives of creative people. It shows how creative figures structure their days to make good use of rest, and why long walks, afternoon naps, vigorous exercise, and "deep play" stimulate creative work and sustain creative lives.<b>Alex Soojung-Kim Pang</b> is founder of The Restful Company, and a visiting scholar at Stanford.

Laing, one of the best-known psychiatrists of modern times, was born in Glasgow in 1927 and graduated from Glasgow University as a doctor of medicine. In the 1960&#39;s he developed the argument that there may be a benefit in allowing acute mental and emotional turmoil in depth to go on and have its way, and that the outcome of such turmoil could have a positive value. He was the first to put such a stand to the test by establishing, with others, residences where persons could live and be free to let happen what will when the acute psychosis is given free rein, or where, at the very least, they receive no treatment they do not want. This work with the Philadelphia Association since 1964, together with his focus on disturbed and disturbing types of interaction in institutions, groups and families, has been both influential and continually controversial. R.D. Laing&#39;s writings range from books on social theory to verse, as well as numerous articles and reviews in scientific journals and the popular press. His publications are: The Divided Self, Self and Others, Interpersonal Perception (with H. Phillipson and A. Robin Lee), Reason and Violence (introduced by Jean-Paul Sartre), Sanity, Madness and the Family (with A. Esterson), The Politics of Experience and The Bird of Paradise, Knots, The Politics of the Family, The Facts of Life, Do You Love Me?, Conversations with Children, Sonnets, The Voice of Experience and Wisdom, Madness and Folly. R.D. Laing died in 1989. Anthony Clare, writing in the Guardian, said of him: &#34;His major achievement was that he dragged the isolated and neglected inner world of the severely psychotic individual out of the back ward of the large gloomy mental hospital and on to the front pages of influential newspapers, journals and literary magazines... Everyone in contemporary psychiatry owes something to R.D. Laing.&#34;"Dr. Laing is saying something very important indeed. . . .

Far in the distance, a red combine rolled through the sallow cornfields. Her father. Harvest time. Her mother was still at work, too, a dental technician at the only practice in town. Which one of them had left it here?<i> </i>The decaying porch boards sagged and splintered beneath Haley&#x2019;s shifting weight as she picked up the timer. It rattled in her hand. The day had been cold, but the plastic eggshell was warm. Faintly so.</p><p>Her phone rang. It was Brooke, of course.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the blood?&#x201d; Haley asked.</p><p>Her best friend groaned. &#x201c;A nightmare.&#x201d;</p><p>Haley went inside, and the screen door banged closed behind her. &#x201c;Any chance that means Ms. Colfax will drop it?&#x201d; She marched straight to the kitchen, slinging her backpack onto its black-and-white checkerboard floor. <i>Sustenance.</i> This afternoon&#x2019;s rehearsal had been particularly grueling.</p><p>&#x201c;Never.&#x201d; Brooke snorted. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll never drop it. Who needs common sense when you have ambition?&#x201d;</p><p>Haley set the timer back on the countertop&#x2014;where it belonged&#x2014;and opened the refrigerator. &#x201c;Normally, I&#x2019;d argue for ambition. But. I&#x2019;m really not looking forward to being drowned in corn syrup.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I had the money, I&#x2019;d buy the professional-grade stuff myself. Cleaning up the auditorium will be hell, even with all the tarps and plastic sheeting.&#x201d;</p><p>Most theatrical productions of <i>Sweeney Todd</i> used at least some amount of fake blood&#x2014;razors with hidden squeeze bulbs, gel capsules in the mouth, false clothing-fronts to conceal bloodstained doubles underneath. Additional mayhem could be implied with red curtains or red lights or a frenzied crescendo of screaming violins.</p><p>Unfortunately, their high school&#x2019;s musical director, Ms. Colfax, had an unquenchable zeal for drama by all its definitions. Last year&#x2019;s production of <i>Peter Pan</i>, for which she&#x2019;d rented actual flying harnesses all the way from New York City, had resulted in the broken bones of both Wendy and Michael Darling. This year, Ms. Colfax didn&#x2019;t just want the demon barber to slit his customers&#x2019; throats. She wanted to shower the first three rows with their blood. She referred to this section of the auditorium as the &#x201c;Splatter Belt.&#x201d;</p><p>Brooke was the stage manager. An honor, for sure, but it came with the impossible task of trying to steer Ms. Colfax toward sanity.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t going well.</p><p>Haley held the phone to her ear with her shoulder as she loaded her arms with packages of deli-sliced turkey and provolone, a bag of prewashed lettuce, and jar of Miracle Whip. &#x201c;Shayna must be flipping her shit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shayna is definitely flipping her shit,&#x201d; Brooke said.</p><p>Shayna was their temperamental&#x2014;often volatile&#x2014;costume designer. It was hard enough to find decent costumes in rural Nebraska with a budget of zero, but now she had to deal with bloodstain removal on top of it.</p><p>&#x201c;Poor Shayna.&#x201d; Haley dumped the ingredients onto the counter. She grabbed the closest loaf of bread, wheat with some kind of herb, which her mother had baked the night before. Her mother baked to relax. She used a bread maker, but still. It was nice.</p><p>&#x201c;Poor <i>Brooke</i>,&#x201d; Brooke said.</p><p>&#x201c;Poor Brooke,&#x201d; Haley agreed.</p><p>&#x201c;And how was Jonathan today? Any better?&#x201d;</p><p>Haley hesitated. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t hear him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was running splatter tests in the parking lot.&#x201d;</p><p>Haley was playing Mrs. Lovett, and Shayna&#x2019;s boyfriend Jonathan was playing Sweeney, the female and male leads. Still only a junior, Haley had been getting leads in drama club and solos in show choir for the last two years. Both a performer and powerful contralto, she was simply <i>better</i> than her peers. A natural. Impossible to overlook.</p><p>Jonathan was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. above average. And he was charismatic, which helped his stage presence. However, this particular musical was well beyond his capabilities. He&#x2019;d been struggling with &#x201c;Epiphany,&#x201d; his most challenging solo song, for weeks. His transitions held all the smoothness of someone stumbling across a bull snake in a tool shed, but even those were nothing compared to the way that he&#x2019;d been massacring his duets.</p><p>Brooke seemed to sense Haley&#x2019;s reluctance to gossip. &#x201c;Oh, come on. If you don&#x2019;t spill, you&#x2019;ll only make me feel guilty for venting about everybody else.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Haley spread a gloppy coat of Miracle Whip onto the bread and then tossed the dirty butter knife into the sink. She&#x2019;d wash it off later. &#x201c;We spent the <i>entire</i> rehearsal on &#x2018;A Little Priest.&#x2019; And not even the whole thing! The same few bars, over and over and over. For two freaking hours.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yikes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know that part where we sing different lines simultaneously? And our voices are supposed to be, like, tumbling over each other in excitement?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When Sweeney finally figured out that Mrs. Lovett wants to dispose of his victims by baking their flesh into her pies?&#x201d; Brooke&#x2019;s voice was a wicked grin.</p><p>&#x201c;It was a disaster.&#x201d; Haley carried her plate into the living room, but she didn&#x2019;t sit. She paced. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think Jonathan can do it. I mean, I seriously think his brain <i>can&#x2019;t do it.</i> He can sing in unison, he can sing harmony&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sort of.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sort of,&#x201d; Haley conceded. &#x201c;But if someone else is singing different words? He keeps stopping and restarting. Like he&#x2019;s trying to work through an aneurysm.&#x201d;</p><p>Brooke laughed.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s why I left early. I felt like such a bitch, but God. I couldn&#x2019;t take it anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one would ever call you a bitch.&#x201d;</p><p>Haley swallowed a huge bite of turkey. It was a balancing act&#x2014;cradling the phone, holding the plate, eating the sandwich, pacing the room&#x2014;but she didn&#x2019;t notice. She was worried. &#x201c;Jonathan would.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jonathan shouldn&#x2019;t have gotten the part.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you think I should call him and apologize?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. <i>No.</i> Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For being short with him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not your fault he can&#x2019;t handle Sondheim.&#x201d;</p><p>This was true, but Haley still felt ashamed for getting so frustrated. For walking out of rehearsal. She plopped onto the ancient corduroy couch, one of the many relics from when the farmhouse had belonged to her grandparents, and sighed. Brooke said something else in best-friend solidarity, but Haley&#x2019;s phone chose that moment to do its usual thing.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d you say? My connection is going in and out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So call me from the landline.&#x201d;</p><p>Haley glanced at the cordless, which was perched on an end table only a few feet away. Too much effort. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine now,&#x201d; she lied.</p><p>Brooke circled the conversation back around to her current hardships as stage manager, and Haley allowed herself to drift away. She could only hear a third of Brooke&#x2019;s ranting, anyway. The rest was static.</p><p>She stared out the windows and finished her sandwich. The sun hung low on the horizon. It shone through the cornfields, making the brittle stalks appear soft and dull. Her father was still out there. Somewhere. This time of year, he didn&#x2019;t let a single ray go to waste. The world looked abandoned. It was the opposite of the loud, colorful, enthusiastic group of people she&#x2019;d left behind at school. She should have stuck it out. She hated the quiet isolation that permeated her house. It was exhausting in its own way.</p><p>Haley made sympathetic noises into the phone&#x2014;though she had no idea what she was sympathizing <i>with</i>&#x2014;and stood. She walked her plate back to the kitchen, rinsed off the crumbs, and popped open the dishwasher.</p><p>The only thing inside it was a dirty butter knife.</p><p>Haley glanced at the sink, which was empty. A frown appeared between her brows. She put the plate into the dishwasher and shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Even if we <i>can</i> get the sprayer working,&#x201d; Brooke was saying, their connection suddenly clear, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure enough people will even <i>want</i> to sit in the first three rows. I mean, who goes to the theater to wear ponchos and get drenched in blood?&#x201d;</p><p>Haley sensed that her friend needed vocal reassurance. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Halloween weekend. People will buy the tickets. They&#x2019;ll think it&#x2019;s fun.&#x201d; She took a step toward the stairs, toward her bedroom, and her sneaker connected with a small, hard object. It shot across the floor tiles, skidding and rattling and clattering and clanging, until it smacked into the bottom of the pantry.</p><p>It was the egg timer.</p><p>Haley&#x2019;s heart stopped. Just for a moment.</p><p>An uneasy prickling grew under her skin as she moved toward the pantry door, which one of her parents had left ajar. She pushed it closed with her fingertips and then picked up the timer, slowly. As if it were heavy. She could have sworn she&#x2019;d set it on the countertop, but she must have dropped it to the floor along with her backpack.</p><p>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. still listening?&#x201d;</p><p>The voice barely reached her ears. &#x201c;Sorry?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I asked if you were still listening to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Haley said again. She stared at the timer. &#x201c;I must be more tired than I thought. I think I&#x2019;m gonna crash until my mom gets home.&#x201d;</p><p>They hung up, and Haley shoved the phone into the front right pocket of her jeans. She placed the timer back on the countertop. The timer was smooth and white. Innocuous. Haley couldn&#x2019;t pinpoint <i>why</i>, exactly, but the damn thing unsettled her.</p><p>She trekked upstairs and went directly to bed, collapsing in a weary heap, kicking off her sneakers, too drained to unlace them. The phone jabbed at her hip. She pulled it from her pocket and slung it onto her nightstand. The setting sun pierced through her window at a perfect, irritating angle, and she winced and rolled over.</p><p>She fell asleep instantly.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Haley startled awake. Her heart was pounding, and the house was dark.</p><p>She exhaled&#x2014;a long, unclenching, diaphragm-deep breath. And that was when her brain processed the noise. The noise that had woken her up.</p><p><i>Ticking.</i></p><p>Haley&#x2019;s blood chilled. She rolled over to face the nightstand. Her phone was gone, and in its place, right at eye level, was the egg timer.</p><p>It went off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter Two</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next morning, the entire school was buzzing about two things: the brutal slaying of Haley Whitehall and Ollie Larsson&#x2019;s newly pinkened hair.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think they&#x2019;d care less about the hair,&#x201d; Makani said.</p><p>&#x201c;This is Osborne, Nebraska.&#x201d; Her friend Darby sucked up the last drops of his gas station iced coffee. &#x201c;Population: twenty-six hundred. A boy with pink hair <i>is</i> as scandalous as the death of a beloved student.&#x201d;</p><p>They stared through Darby&#x2019;s windshield and across the parking lot to where Ollie was leaning against the brick wall of the front office. He was reading a paperback and pointedly ignoring the �whispers&#x2014;and not-whispers&#x2014;of the other students.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard her throat was slit in three places.&#x201d; Makani paused. The car&#x2019;s windows were down, so she lowered her voice. &#x201c;Carved up to look like a smiley face.&#x201d;</p><p>The straw dropped from Darby&#x2019;s mouth. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s <i>awful</i>. Who told you that?&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugged uncomfortably. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just what I heard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh God. And the day hasn&#x2019;t even begun.&#x201d;</p><p>A long face with kohl-blackened eyes popped up beside the �passenger-side window. &#x201c;Well, <i>I </i>heard&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Makani jumped. &#x201c;Jesus, Alex.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2014;that Ollie is the one who did it. And that he used her blood to dye his hair.&#x201d;</p><p>Makani and Darby stared at her, agape.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m kidding. Obviously.&#x201d; She opened the back door, tossed in her trumpet case, and slid inside. The car was their morning hangout. &#x201c;But someone here will say it.&#x201d;</p><p>There was too much truth in her joke. Makani winced.</p><p>Alex kicked the back of Makani&#x2019;s seat with a royal-blue combat boot. An exclamation point. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe it. You still have a thing for him, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Unfortunately, yes.</p><p>Of course she still had a thing for Ollie.</p><p>From the moment Makani Young arrived in Nebraska, she couldn&#x2019;t keep her eyes off him. He was, without a doubt, the �strangest-looking guy at Osborne High. But that also made him the most <i>interesting.</i> Ollie had a skinny frame with hip bones that jutted out in a way that reminded her of sex, and cheekbones so prominent they reminded her of a skull&#x2014;the illusion of which was enhanced by his blond, invisible eyebrows. He always wore dark jeans and a plain, black T-shirt. A silver ring&#x2014;a thin hoop in the center of his bottom lip&#x2014;was his only adornment. He kind of looked like a skeleton.</p><p>Makani tilted her head. But maybe less so, now that his white-blond hair was a shocking hot pink.</p><p>&#x201c;I remember when <i>you</i> had a thing for him,&#x201d; Darby said to Alex.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, like, in eighth grade. Until I realized he&#x2019;s a full-time loner. He&#x2019;s not interested in going out with anyone who attends this school.&#x201d; With a rare and embarrassed afterthought, Alex grimaced. &#x201c;Sorry, Makani.&#x201d;</p><p>Makani and Ollie had hooked up last summer. Sort of. Thankfully, the only people who knew about it were sitting here in Darby&#x2019;s car.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; Makani said, because it was easier than saying it wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>There were a lot of rumors about Ollie: That he only slept with older women; that he only slept with older men; that he sold opioids stolen from his brother&#x2019;s police station; that he once almost drowned in the shallow part of the river. That&#x2014;when he was rescued&#x2014;he was both blind drunk and buck naked.</p><p>Then again, their school was small. There were rumors about everyone.</p><p>Makani knew better than to believe any of them outright. Rumors, even the true ones, never told a complete story. She avoided most of her classmates for that very reason. Self-preservation. Recognizing a similarly dismal soul, Darby and Alex had taken her in when she&#x2019;d been forced to relocate from Hawaii midway through her junior year. Her parents were embattled in an ugly divorce, so they&#x2019;d shipped her off to live with her grandmother for some normalcy.</p><p><i>Normalcy.</i> With her <i>grandmother.</i> In the <i>middle of</i> <i>nowhere.</i></p><p>At least, that&#x2019;s how Makani told the story to her friends. And, much like a rumor, it did contain a kernel of truth. It was just missing the rest of the cob.</p><p>Her parents had never paid much attention to her, even in the best of times, and they&#x2019;d only recently separated when the incident at the beach occurred. After that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they couldn&#x2019;t look at her at all anymore. She didn&#x2019;t like looking at herself, either.</p><p>She deserved this exile.</p><p>Now it was mid-October, and Makani had been in Osborne for almost a year. She was a senior, and so were Darby and Alex. Their mutual interest was counting down the days until graduation. Makani wasn&#x2019;t sure where she&#x2019;d go next, but she certainly wasn&#x2019;t staying here.</p><p>&#x201c;Can we return to the important subject?&#x201d; Darby asked. &#x201c;Haley is <i>dead. </i>And no one knows who killed her, and that freaks my shit out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you didn&#x2019;t like Haley,&#x201d; Alex said, pulling her dyed-black hair into a complicated twist that required a large number of chunky plastic barrettes. She was the closest thing their school had to a Goth, if you didn&#x2019;t count Ollie.</p><p>Makani didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Their exteriors were both comprised of blac...</p></p><h2>The Anatomy of Stretching, Second Edition: Your Illustrated Guide to Flexibility and Injury Rehabilitation</h2><p>The multiple stresses of contemporary life&#x2014;whether from excessive sports play, overwork, or overuse of technology&#x2014;are increasingly taking a toll on the body. Symptoms range from muscle soreness and pain to pinched nerves to potentially more permanent disabilities, including serious body injuries. One safe, quickly productive way to address the problem is through a simple therapy that can be done anywhere, anytime, and without special equipment: stretching. This new edition of Brad Walker&#x2019;s best-selling book on the subject presents 135 unique stretching&nbsp;exercises designed to help repair the body and make it more flexible, fit, and relaxed.<br> &nbsp;<br> The book begins with clear, detailed descriptions of important principles of anatomy and physiology, the benefits of stretching, different forms of stretching, rules to remember, and how to stretch properly. It also focuses on the kinds of stretches that are most helpful in the alleviation or rehabilitation of specific sports injuries. Organized by body part, <i>The Anatomy of Stretching </i>presents stretching exercises in a uniform style accompanied by full-color anatomical illustrations. Equally useful for fitness fans, pro or amateur athletes, coaches and personal trainers, and healthcare practitioners, this new edition contains 20 new stretches; expanded physiology and anatomy information; and a revised numbering system that makes the stretches easier to reference. An expanded appendix includes a longer resources section and a helpful chart describing the top five stretches for each sport and sports injury.</p><p>Brad Walker is an internationally known stretching and sports injury consultant with 20 years of experience in the health and fitness industry. His other books&nbsp;include <i>The Stretching Handbook </i>and <i>The Anatomy of Sports Injuries. </i>He lives in Queensland, Australia.&#x201c;My favorite part is the illustrations: they're black and white except for the muscle that's being stretched... If you're interested in stretching, improving your range of motion, improving your athletic ability by improving your body's muscles in repairing themselves, or simply to understand what each stretch does for your body, I highly recommend picking up this book. 5 stars.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Kari, <i>Reading for Sanity</i></p><h2>The South Beach Diet Supercharged: Faster Weight Loss and Better Health for Life</h2><p><p>Five years ago, with the publication of <i>The South Beach Diet</i>, renowned Miami cardiologist Dr. Arthur Agatston set out to change the way America eats.

Dr. Agatston has published more than 100 scientific articles and abstracts in medical journals, and recently he received the prestigious Alpha Omega Award from New York University Medical Center for outstanding achievement in the medical profession. He lives in Miami Beach with his wife, Sari.</p><p><b>Joseph Signorile</b>, Ph.D., is a professor of exercise physiology and assistant director of the Laboratory of Clinical and Applied Physiology at the University of Miami. He is widely published and lectures frequently on the subjects of exercise training, muscle physiology, and metabolism.</p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p><p>Changing the Way America Lives </p><p>The South Beach Diet was always intended to be more than just a diet. In fact, it was originally developed to help my cardiac and diabetes patients lose weight in order to prevent heart attacks and strokes. As a cardiologist, I have always felt that the South Beach Diet is less about dieting and more about living a long, healthy, and active life. I wrote the original book in 2003 because I wanted to help change the way America eats. Now I have a new goal: I want to change the way America lives, not only by helping people eat healthfully and lose weight, if necessary, but also by helping them become more fit. We must begin to overcome the poor eating habits and sedentary lifestyle that are making us fatter and sicker with each passing year. </p><p>Over the past several decades, we have witnessed an unexpected epidemic of obesity in this country. One-third of American adults over age 20 are obese, and two-thirds of us are overweight. The number of seriously overweight children has tripled. Moreover, statistics show that 51 percent of Americans don&#x2019;t engage in any kind of regular physical activity. The results have been catastrophic. </p><p>This epidemic of obesity is causing an array of health problems that is much broader than we doctors ever imagined. Beyond the cosmetic concerns that pervade our culture, the list of real problems arising from our toxic lifestyle is getting ever longer. A partial list includes&#x2014;and you may want to sit down for this&#x2014;heart attack, stroke, prediabetes, diabetes, many types of cancer, Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, macular degeneration, arthritis, osteoporosis, psoriasis, acne, depression, and attention deficit disorders. And this is just a sampling. </p><p>It also appears that if we do not reverse the health course that we are on, the cost in human and economic terms will reach crisis proportions. Our poor diet and sedentary lifestyle are already exacting a steep toll in terms of mortality and money. They&#x2019;re responsible for an estimated 300,000 premature deaths every year and $90 billion in health-care costs, but I believe the real costs are much higher. And as the baby boom generation gets older, these health costs will likely continue to soar. </p><p>Sadly, this is not only an American problem. Just as our sedentary, fastfood lifestyle is being exported around the world, so are the attendant health problems. The good news is that now that we better understand what&#x2019;s happening to us, we can start to create solutions. </p><p>A Sedentary Nation </p><p>In order to develop strategies to halt and reverse the epidemic of obesity, we must be aware of the trends that have gradually but inexorably brought us to the crisis situation we are in today. I have found in my practice that by putting patients&#x2019; current problems into a context they can understand, they can more easily become cooperative partners in moving toward solutions. Perhaps because I was a history major (not all doctors are bio majors), I also find that tracing today&#x2019;s health problems back to their original roots is fascinating. </p><p>The truth is that while our bad diet and unhealthy lifestyle have been many decades in the making, the toxic changes in the way we live have really accelerated in recent years. Our DNA is designed to live, eat, and exercise the way our hunter-gatherer ancestors did, and it hasn&#x2019;t changed substantially since that time. But we no longer live in the wild. We don&#x2019;t have famine in this country to keep us thin. We no longer burn calories hunting and gathering our food. </p><p>On top of that, a completely sedentary lifestyle has gradually crept in, invention by incredible invention. Due to the march of technology, we sit in front of computers both at work and at home. Machines and gadgets lift, move, and carry things for us. We communicate by e-mail, and many of us don&#x2019;t even walk down the hall to chat with colleagues as often as we used to! While studies document how much less physical exertion we&#x2019;re doing, we really don&#x2019;t need research studies to appreciate the trend. All we have to do is look around. </p><p>The preponderance of labor-saving devices, from tractors and forklifts to remote controls and the personal computer, has had a major impact on the number of calories we expend daily at home and at work. These devices have also had devastating effects on our muscles, bones, tendons, and ligaments. Sitting bent over at a computer for most of the day is simply not good for our health. In Chapter 5, &#x201c;Boomeritis: The New Epidemic!&#x201d; I talk about these evolving physical problems and their solutions. And in Part II of the book, I present the South Beach Supercharged Fitness Program. Not only will this 20-minute-a-day program help you burn more calories even when you&#x2019;re not working out, it will also strengthen the key core muscles in your abdomen, back, pelvis, and hips. It&#x2019;s your core muscles that help you avoid the back pain and other muscle problems that so often result from our sedentary lives. </p><p>Missing Our Nutrients </p><p>Our unhealthy lifestyle is made even worse by our poor diet. Since we began growing fields of grain about 10,000 years ago and developed the ability to cultivate fruits and vegetables, the nutritional content of our foods has seriously deteriorated. This is because we tend to breed plants for hardiness, taste, and aesthetics, not nutrients. Today, the fruits and vegetables we find in most supermarkets are larger, sweeter, and better-looking than those our ancestors gathered. The problem is that they also have less fiber and fewer vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients than is optimal for our general health&#x2014;not to mention our waistlines. Luckily, more and more Americans are embracing organic foods, heirloom fruits and vegetables, and sustainable farming methods, all trends that are bringing food back to its more natural and nutritious state. In Chapter 7, &#x201c;Supercharged Foods for Better Health,&#x201c; I recommend some foods with powerful nutritional benefits that can help you stay healthy and avoid the host of chronic and degenerative diseases currently affecting so many of us. </p><p>A Nation Overprocessed </p><p>Beyond our desire to cultivate and produce food almost exclusively to please our tastebuds, other social and technological trends have affected our food supply for the worse. A few generations ago, our great grandparents walked to local markets on a daily basis to buy whatever produce they didn&#x2019;t grow themselves as well as fresh bread and other food for their families&#x2019; next meals. They could only travel to local markets and take home what they were able to carry. With the advent of the automobile and the home refrigerator, however, it became possible to travel farther to shop, and people could take home enough food to feed their families for a week or two. But for that to be possible, foods had to have longer shelf lives. This led to supermarkets and to food processing, which, unfortunately, removed important nutrients while adding substances like sodium and trans fats to prevent spoilage. In a sense, we began digesting our food in factories instead of in our intestines. </p><p>It&#x2019;s only now that we are appreciating the deleterious effects these technological &#x201c;advances&#x201d; have had on our weight and on our health. In Chapter 3, &#x201c;A Diet You Can Live With... For Life,&#x201c; I discuss the health and character of a Mediterranean society that thrived without many of our modern advances, and I show you how we can learn from this remarkable example. </p><p>We Must Act Now </p><p>If you&#x2019;re like me, you find how we got into this sad state not only depressing but scary. But there is hope if we take action today. Because we finally understand so much of what has gone wrong, we can use our advanced technologies to turn things around. We now know that our increasing waistlines, poor physical fitness, and worsening health are not different It was 2003, and my husband had very high blood pressure that wasn&#x2019;t being controlled, even with medication. I was very overweight and knew that we both needed to make a change. The South Beach Diet had just come out, and I went to the bookstore to look over a copy. The first thing I turned to was the recipe section. It was great. I love to cook and was thrilled that I didn&#x2019;t have to give it up. </p><p>After reading the book, I realized that I ate way too many bad carbs all day, like crackers and cookies. Once I stopped eating enriched white flour, I noticed a complete change in everything about me, including my mood and energy level, and I started losing weight. Within a year, I lost 45 pounds, and my husband lost 20. Although he still takes medication for high blood pressure, it&#x2019;s now under control. </p><p>Now I&#x2019;m the go-to girl at work for healthy-food questions. When we have luncheons, everyone knows they can count on me to bring in something healthy. I have learned how to take bad carbs out of a recipe and replace them with good carbs. I am passionate about telling people to read food labels! Don&#x2019;t be fooled; buy only whole-grain products. If it says &#x201c;enriched white flour,&#x201c; find something else. </p><p>In 2005, we had an 11-year-old foster youth come to live with us. He was overweight and already taking medication for high blood pressure. He lived on junk food. We took him to a doctor, who told us that he shouldn&#x2019;t go on a diet&#x2014;he should start living a healthy lifestyle. I decided to give him the same healthy food my husband and I were eating, but I told him he could eat as much as he wanted. He also started exercising. Simply by eating the right foods and being more active, he started losing weight fairly quickly. By the end of 4 months, he was off the blood pressure medication, and by the time he left us 18 months later, he had lost 30 pounds. While living with us, he learned how to read food labels and make good food choices. I hope he continues to live a healthy life. My husband often jokes that I should open my home ...</p></p><h2>I&#39;m OK--You&#39;re OK</h2><p><p><strong>The Classic Bestseller That has Changed the Lives of Millions</strong></p><p><strong>"Extraordinary.

They want to be captured in my embrace, and press their breasts against my chest. </p><p> Some females ask if they can just touch me. Some tremble when my hands touch them. They say they love the muscles in my arms. They surrender when I lift them up. They whine and moan in rapture. Some cry their pleasure. Some shake.

Any male who cannot identify his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather is already lost. </p><p> These three names are what makes a boy who he is. There is no talk of role models and celebrities. A son is raised under his father's wing, with a grandfather to guide and a great-grandfather as a blueprint, plus an army of uncles nearby. </p><p> Where I'm from, a man does not bow to any other man. A man bows down only to Allah. Only Allah created the heavens, the galaxies, the universe, and all of the millions of creatures within. </p><p> My father had three wives. Not one wife, one wifey, and a bunch of random bitches on the side. </p><p> Where I am from, a man wants to marry a woman and establish a strong family. A man can have more than one wife as long as he can treat them all fairly and provide them with love, separate homes, food, guidance, and presence. </p><p> There is no such thing as domestic drama. A woman feels fortunate to be selected by a quality husband, a family man, who will be by her side for her entire lifetime. Families are permanent. </p><p> When a man is ready to build his family, he selects a woman who he likes, who is from a family who raised her right, a woman who knows how to love and live. She has to be good for him, his beliefs, and plans for life. Someone who brings him peace, progress, and pleasure. Then he is down for her for real. </p><p> She is down for him too because she feels his strength, craves his love and attention, feels safe tucked at his side, and is confident that every day he is making the right moves for her, his family, and himself. </p><p> Our women don't argue with their man. A man knows what he is supposed to do and not do. It is the same thing he watched his own father do and not do. So he does it. Even if a man selects the wrong path, his punishment is between himself and Allah. His woman cannot punish him, judge him, or nag him to death. </p><p> In my country, a wife is not a whore or ex-whore. Every move a woman makes matters. She can bring dishonor to her man and family even with a simple glance at another man, if it is held for too long. </p><p> Even where I am from, there are whores. They know their place too. They stay within the walls of the illegal whorehouse, never to be glorified, honored, claimed, or married. A whore, where I am from, is the opposite of arrogant. She is used but never celebrated by decent men or women. She knows that she can never enjoy the lifestyle and contentment of a respected sister, daughter, mother, or wife. </p><p> The punishment for a good woman who comes from a good family and suddenly behaves whorish is severe. She will be isolated by her parents, family, and friends. Her father and mother may lock her away and confine her to one room in the house. In some cases, she is even murdered by her own husband, father, or brother for bringing shame and dishonor to her family and the people who raised, guided, loved, and provided for her. </p><p> The family member who commits the murder is not arrested. The whole country acknowledges that a woman is sacred. Every move she makes is either building her family up or breaking it down. Every thought she has is felt and considered by her children. Every word she speaks either teaches or misleads. She must remain honorable, pure, and righteous, otherwise there will be no happiness, no family, and no reason to exist. </p><p> Mouthing off; fucking her man's friends, brothers, and cousins; running away with the children; aborting the babies; lying about who is the father of her children; not knowing who the father is; yelling and disrespecting; doing drugs; drinking; parading around mostly naked; acting crazy; our men don't stand for that. We have not experienced that. We never will. </p><p> Our women know their place. They stay in it and live and thrive there. They remain there happily. Our women give love and are loved even more. She is respected, protected, and provided for. She lives proud and at peace. </p><p> Where I am from, liquor is illegal and forbidden. We believe that it makes a man behave with ignorance. After drinking liquor, the next step, we believe, is to disgrace God, and destroy yourself and your family. </p><p> In my country, homosexuality is nonexistent. For the absolute majority it is unknown and undone. There have been one or two of those who have traveled out to other places in Europe or America and come back with this bizarre behavior. However, they could never remain with us. Their homosexuality resulted in suicides, or they just turned up missing. </p><p> There are no tears for the man who enters into the exit, and builds a life where there can be no balance, reproduction, or family. </p><p> Where I am from, adultery is a crime for a man or a woman. Even to fuck someone else's sister or daughter just because you feel like it or like the way she looks, without approaching her family for marriage, means that you have brought about a battle between dishonored families, yours and hers. The man who commits adultery will be punished by his family. The woman who commits adultery will be considered ruined. </p><p> Where I am from, men work. Whether he works his own land and is paid in the foods the Earth produces; whether he works someone else's land; whether he is paid in cash, cattle, or otherwise; he works. Hard work is a man's way of providing for and demonstrating that he loves his family. </p><p> Each man must have a business of products or services. His product might be fish, meats, vegetables, fruits, jewelry, clothing, crafts, furniture, vehicles, parts and supplies, or other items. Or he may provide services as a doctor, carpenter, construction worker, engineer, lawyer, driver, educator, or performer. But no man can sit doing nothing. His family, backed up by the entire community, would never allow it. </p><p> When I talk about where I am from, which is almost never, both males and females feel uneasy. Some look at me in disbelief, like I'm a fucking liar. Others stare off in complete boredom, like it is not a life they would ever want to live. But I feel fine. People where I am from are happy, while almost everybody I know in America feels fucked up, empty, and dissatisfied, especially the Black people. </p><p> At fourteen years young, I became a citizen of the United States. It was supposed to be a great day, to be remembered for a lifetime. There we were, becoming a part of what is known as the best country in the world, America, after having been born and living inside of what Americans consider the worse place in the world, the continent of Africa. </p><p> We got dressed up and took the A train to City Hall in New York City. We recited some things that we had already memorized. Then it became official. </p><p> I should say it became legal. I was an American on paper. I never became one in my heart or mind. </p><p> The year I became an American was the same year I got locked up. I went from the projects, to juvenile detention, to prison. Each year I became more and more familiar with the American Blacks. The ones who look just like me. They range from very light skin to my rich dark color, as it is back home. When I first arrived, they were Afro-Americans, then Blacks, then African Americans, and eventually niggas. </p><p> They talked like they were the most powerful, clever motherfuckers on the planet. They looked down on other Blacks arriving from any other country in the world. They hated every accent besides their own. They was quick to ...</p></p><h2>DeLorme� Virginia Atlas &amp; Gazetteer (Virginia Atlas &amp; Gazeteer)</h2><p>DeLorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteers Are the Outdoor Enthusiasts' Choice Amazingly detailed and beautifully crafted, large-format paper maps for all 50 states Topographic maps with elevation contours, major highways and roads, dirt roads, trails and land use data Gazetteer section contains information essential for any outdoor enthusiast, such as points of interest, landmarks, state and national parks, campgrounds, boat launches, golf courses, historic sites, hunting zones, canoe trips, scenic drive recommendations and more (Note: available information varies by state) Perfect for sightseeing, exploring back roads, outdoor recreation and trip planning The Perfect Companion for Outdoor Recreation and Trip Planning Rely on DeLorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteer paper maps for the utmost in trip planning and backcountry access.

But she didn't expect to be lectured for slipping her fussing toddler a snack, or to be forbidden from packing her older daughter a school lunch. Karen is intrigued by the fact that French children happily eat everything&#x2014;from beets to broccoli, from salad to spinach&#x2014;while French obesity rates are a fraction of what they are in North America.</p><p>Karen soon begins to see the wisdom in the "food rules" that the French use to foster healthy eating habits and good manners in babies and children. Some of the rules call into question both our eating habits and our parenting styles. Other rules evoke commonsense habits that we used to share but have somehow forgotten. Taken together, the rules suggest that we need to dramatically rethink the way we feed children, at home and at school.</p><p>Combining personal anecdotes with practical tips and appetizing recipes&#x2014;including Zucchini and Spinach Puree and Bouillabaisse (Fish Soup) for Babies&#x2014;<em>French Kids Eat Everything</em> is a humorous, provocative look at families, food, and children that is filled with inspiration and advice that every parent can use.</p><p>Karen Bakker Le Billon is a professor at the University of British Columbia, and was named one of Canada&#x2019;s Top 40 Under 40 in 2011.

Screamer&#x2019;s was packed tonight, full of women wearing leather and men who looked like they had advanced degrees in violent crime.</p><p>Darius and his companion fit right in.</p><p>Except they actually were killers.</p><p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re really going to do this?&#x201d; Tohrment asked him.</p><p>Darius glanced across the shallow table. The other vampire&#x2019;s eyes met his own. &#x201c;Yeah. I am.&#x201d;</p><p>Tohrment nursed his Scotch and smiled grimly. Only the very tips of his fangs showed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re crazy, D.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You should know.&#x201d;</p><p>Tohrment tilted his glass in deference. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re raising the bar. You want to take an innocent girl, who has no idea what the hell she&#x2019;s getting into, and put her transition in the hands of someone like Wrath. That&#x2019;s whacked.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t evil. In spite of the way he looks.&#x201d; Darius finished his beer. &#x201c;And show a little respect.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I respect the hell out of him. But it&#x2019;s a bad idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I need him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sure about that?&#x201d;</p><p>A woman wearing a micromini, thigh-high boots, and a bustier made of chains trolled by their table. Her eyes glittered from behind two pounds of mascara, and she worked her walk as if her hips were double-jointed.</p><p>Darius gave her a pass. Sex was not on his mind tonight.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s my daughter, Tohr.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a half-breed, D. And you know how he feels about humans.&#x201d; Tohrment shook his head. &#x201c;My great-great-grandmother was one, and you don&#x2019;t see me yakking that up around him.&#x201d;</p><p>Darius lifted his hand to catch their waitress&#x2019;s eye and pointed at his empty bottle and Tohrment&#x2019;s nearly dry glass. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to let another one of my children die. Not if there&#x2019;s a possibility I can save her. And anyway, there&#x2019;s no telling whether she&#x2019;ll even go through the change. She could end up living a happy life, never knowing about my side. It&#x2019;s happened before.&#x201d;</p><p>And he hoped his daughter would be spared. Because if she went through her transition, if she came out alive on the other side as a vampire, she was going to be hunted as they all were.</p><p>&#x201c;Darius, if he does it at all, he&#x2019;ll do it because he owes you. Not because he wants to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take him any way I can get him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But what are you giving her? He&#x2019;s about as nurturing as a sawed-off, and that first time can be rough, even if you&#x2019;ve been prepared. Which she hasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to talk to her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how&#x2019;s that going to go? You&#x2019;re just going to walk up to her and say, &#x2018;Hey, I know you&#x2019;ve never seen me before, but I&#x2019;m your dad. Oh, and guess what? You&#x2019;ve won the evolutionary lottery: You&#x2019;re a vampire. Let&#x2019;s go to Disneyland!&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hate you right now.&#x201d;</p><p>Tohrment leaned forward, his thick shoulders shifting under black leather. &#x201c;You know I got your back. I&#x2019;m just thinking you should reconsider.&#x201d; There was a heavy pause. &#x201c;Maybe I could do it.&#x201d;</p><p>Darius shot him a dry look. &#x201c;You want to try and get back into your house after the fact? Wellsie will stake you through the heart and leave you for the sun, my friend.&#x201d;</p><p>Tohrment winced. &#x201c;Good point.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And then she&#x2019;ll come looking for me.&#x201d;</p><p>Both males shuddered.</p><p>&#x201c;Besides...&#x201d; Darius leaned back as the waitress put their drinks down. He waited until she left, even though hard-core rap was pumping all around them. &#x201c;Besides, we&#x2019;re living in dangerous times. If something happens to me&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care of her.&#x201d;</p><p>Darius clapped his friend on the shoulder. &#x201c;I know you will.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But Wrath is better.&#x201d; There was no jealousy in the remark. It was a statement of fact.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no one like him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And thank God for that,&#x201d; Tohrment said with a half smile.</p><p>Their band of brothers, a tight circle of strong-backed warriors who traded information and fought together, were of the same opinion. Wrath was off the chain when it came to the business of vengeance, and he hunted their enemies with a single-minded purpose that bordered on the insane. He was the last of his line, the only purebred vampire left on the planet, and though his race revered him as its king, he despised his status.</p><p>It was almost tragic that he was the best bet Darius&#x2019;s half-breed daughter had of surviving. Wrath&#x2019;s blood, so strong, so untainted, would increase the chances of her getting through the transition if it hit her. But Tohrment wasn&#x2019;t off the mark. It was like turning a virgin over to a thug.</p><p>With a sudden rush, the crowd shifted, people backing into each other. They were making way for someone. Or something.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit. Here he comes,&#x201d; Tohrment muttered. He tossed back his Scotch, swallowing it whole. &#x201c;No offense, but I&#x2019;m outtie. This is not a conversation I need to be a part of.&#x201d;</p><p>Darius watched the sea of humans split as they steered clear of an imposing, dark shadow that towered over them. The flight response was a good survival reflex.</p><p>Wrath was six feet, six inches of pure terror dressed in leather. His hair was long and black, falling straight from a widow&#x2019;s peak. Wraparound sunglasses hid eyes that no one had ever seen revealed. Shoulders were twice the size of most males&#x2019;. With a face that was both aristocratic and brutal, he looked like the king he was by birthright and the soldier he&#x2019;d become by destiny.</p><p>And that wave of menace rolling ahead of him was one hell of a calling card.</p><p>As the cool hatred hit Darius, he tilted his fresh beer back and drank deeply.</p><p>He hoped to God he was doing the right thing.</p><p>Beth Randall looked up as her editor leaned his hip on her desk. His eyes went straight to the vee of her shirt.</p><p>&#x201c;Working late again,&#x201d; he murmured.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Dick.&#x201d;</p><p>Shouldn&#x2019;t you be getting home to your wife and two kids? she mentally added.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Editing a piece for Tony.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know, there are other ways of impressing me.&#x201d;</p><p>Yeah, she could just imagine.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you read my e-mail, Dick? I went down to the police station this afternoon and talked with Jos� and Ricky. They swear a gun dealer&#x2019;s moved into town. They&#x2019;ve found two modified Magnums on drug dealers.&#x201d;</p><p>Dick reached out to pat her shoulder, stroking it as he took his hand back. &#x201c;You just keep working the blotter. Let the big boys worry about the violent crimes. We wouldn&#x2019;t want anything to happen to that pretty face of yours.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled, eyes growing hooded as his gaze lingered on her lips.</p><p>That stare routine had gotten old three years ago, she thought. Right after she&#x2019;d started working for him.</p><p>A paper bag. What she needed was a paper bag to pull over her head whenever she talked with him. Maybe with a picture of Mrs. Dick taped to the front.</p><p>&#x201c;Would you like me to give you a ride home?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>Only if it were raining thumbtacks and hairpins, you letch.</p><p>&#x201c;No, thanks.&#x201d; Beth turned back to her computer screen and hoped he&#x2019;d take the hint.</p><p>Eventually he wandered off, probably heading for the bar across the street that most of the reporters hit before going home. Caldwell, New York, wasn&#x2019;t exactly a hotbed of opportunity for any journalist, but Dick&#x2019;s big boys sure liked keeping up the appearance of carrying a heavy social burden. They relished cozying up to the bar at Charlie&#x2019;s and talking about the days when they&#x2019;d worked at bigger, more important papers. For the most part they were just like Dick: middle-aged, middle-of-the-road men who were competent, but not extraordinary at what they did. Caldwell was big enough and close enough to New York City to have the nasty business of violent crimes, drug busts, and prostitution, so they were kept busy. But the Caldwell Courier Journal was not the Times, and none of them was ever going to win a Pulitzer.</p><p>It was rather sad.</p><p>Yeah, well, look in the mirror, Beth thought. She was just a beat reporter. She&#x2019;d never even worked at a national-level paper. So when she was in her fifties, unless things changed, she&#x2019;d have to be at a free press polishing classifieds to have a shot at reflected glory from her CCJ days.</p><p>She reached for the bag of M &amp; M&#x2019;s she&#x2019;d been nursing. The damn thing was empty. Again.</p><p>She should probably just go home. And pick up some Chinese down the street.</p><p>On her way out of the newsroom, which was an open space cut up into cubicles by flimsy gray partitions, she hit her buddy Tony&#x2019;s stash of Twinkies. Tony ate all the time. For him, there was no breakfast, lunch, and dinner: Consumption was a binary proposition. If he was awake, something was going into his mouth, and to keep himself supplied, his desk was a treasure trove of caloric depravity.</p><p>She peeled off the cellophane and couldn&#x2019;t believe she was biting into the artificial swill as she hit the lights and walked down the stairwell to Trade Street. Outside, the heat of July was a physical barrier between her and her apartment. Twelve straight blocks of hot and humid. Fortunately, the Chinese restaurant was halfway home and heavily air-conditioned. With any luck they&#x2019;d be busy tonight, so she&#x2019;d get to wait a while in the coolness.</p><p>When she was finished with the Twinkie, she flipped open her phone, hit speed dial, and put in an order for beef with broccoli. As she walked along, she looked at the familiar, grim landmarks. Along this stretch of Trade Street, there were only bars, strip clubs, and the occasional tattoo parlor. The Chinese food place and the Tex-Mex buffet were the only two restaurants. The rest of the buildings, which had been used as offices in the twenties, when downtown had been thriving, were vacant. She knew every crack in the sidewalk; she could time the traffic lights. And the patois of sounds drifting out of open doors and windows offered no surprises either.</p><p>McGrider&#x2019;s Bar was playing blues; Zero Sum had bleating techno coming out of its glass entrance; and the karaoke machines were fired up at Ruben&#x2019;s. Most of the places were reputable enough, but there were a couple she stayed away from on principle. Screamer&#x2019;s in particular catered to a scary-ass clientele. That was one door she wouldn&#x2019;t go through without a police escort.</p><p>As she measured the distance to the Chinese restaurant, a wave of fatigue hit her. God, it was humid. The air was so heavy she felt as if she were breathing water.</p><p>She had a feeling the exhaustion wasn&#x2019;t just about the weather. She&#x2019;d been pooped for weeks, and suspected she was dancing with depression. Her job was going nowhere. She was living in a place she didn&#x2019;t care about. She had few friends, no lover, and no romantic prospects. If she looked ahead ten years and pictured herself staying put in Caldwell with Dick and the big boys, she only saw more of the same routine: getting up, going to work, trying to make a difference, failing, going home alone.</p><p>Maybe she just needed out. Out of Caldwell. Out of the CCJ. Out of the electronic family of her alarm clock and the phone on her desk and the TV that kept her dreams away while she slept.</p><p>God knew there was nothing keeping her in town but habit. She hadn&#x2019;t spoken to any of her foster parents for years, so they wouldn&#x2019;t miss her. And the few friends she had were busy with their own families.</p><p>When she heard a leering whistle behind her, she rolled her eyes. That was the problem with working near the bars. On occasion you picked up gawkers.</p><p>The catcalls came next, and then, sure enough, two guys crossed the street at a jog and came after her. She looked around. She was heading away from the bars and into the long stretch of vacant buildings before the restaurants. The night was thick and dark, but at least there were streetlights and the occasional car passing.</p><p>&#x201c;I like your black hair,&#x201d; the big one said as he fell into step beside her. &#x201c;Mind if I touch it?&#x201d;</p><p>Beth knew better than to stop. They looked like college frat boys out for the summer, which meant they were just going to be annoying, but she didn&#x2019;t want to take any chances. Besides, the Chinese place was only five blocks up.</p><p>She reached into her purse anyway, searching for her pepper spray.</p><p>&#x201c;You need a ride somewhere?&#x201d; the big guy asked. &#x201c;My car&#x2019;s not far. Seriously, how &#x2019;bout you come with us? We could go for a little ride.&#x201d;</p><p>He grinned and winked at his buddy, as if the smooth rap was definitely going to get him laid. The crony laughed and circled her, his thin blond hair flopping as he skipped.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s ride her!&#x201d; the blond said.</p><p>Damn it, where was her spray?</p><p>The big one reached out, touching her hair, and she looked at him good and hard. With his polo shirt and his khaki shorts, he was BMOC handsome. Real all-American material.</p><p>When he smiled at her, she sped up, focusing on the dim neon glow of the Chinese place&#x2019;s sign. She was praying someone else would walk by, but heat had driven the pedestrian traffic indoors. There was no one around.</p><p>&#x201c;You want to tell me your name?&#x201d; all-American asked.</p><p>Her heart started banging in her chest. The spray was in her other bag.</p><p>Four more blocks.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll just pick a name for you. Let me think...How&#x2019;s pussycat sound?&#x201d;</p><p>The blond giggled.</p><p>She swallowed and took out her cell phone, just in case she needed to call 911.</p><p>Stay calm. Keep it together.</p><p>She pictured how good the rush of air-conditioning in the restaurant was going to feel as she went inside. Maybe she&#x2019;d wait and call a cab, just to make sure she got home without being further harassed by them.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, pussycat,&#x201d; all-American cooed. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re going to like me.&#x201d;</p><p>Only three more blocks...</p><p>Just as she stepped off the curb to cross Tenth Street, he grabbed her around the waist. Her feet popped off the ground, and as he dragged her backward, he covered her mouth with a heavy palm. She fought like a madwoman, kicking and punching, and when she reached behind and belted him in the eye, his grip slipped. She lunged away from him, legs driving her heels hard into the pavement, breath trapped in her throat. A car went by out on Trade Street, and she yelled as its headlights flared.</p><p>But then he got her again.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to beg for it, bitch,&#x201d; all-American said in her ear as he put her in a choke hold. He wrenched her neck around until she thought it was going to snap and pulled her deeper into the shadows. She could smell his sweat and the college-boy cologne he wore, could hear the high-pitched laughter of his friend.</p><p>An alley. They were taking her into an alley.</p><p>Her stomach heaved, bile stinging her throat, and she jerked her body around furiously, trying to get free. Panic made her strong. But he was stronger.</p><p>He pushed her behind a Dumpster and pressed his body into hers. She drove her elbow into his ribs and kicked some more.</p><p>&#x201c;Goddamn it, get her arms!&#x201d;</p><p>She got in one good heel punch to the blond&#x2019;s shins before he caught her wrists and held them over her head.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, bitch, you&#x2019;re going to like this,&#x201d; all-American growled, trying to get his knee between her legs.</p><p>He ground her back against the building&#x2019;s brick wall, holding her in place by the throat. He had to use his other hand to rip open her shirt, and as soon as her mouth was free, she screamed. He slapped her hard, and she felt her lip split open. Blood rushed onto her tongue, pain stunning her.</p><p>&#x201c;You do tha...</p></p><h2>Baseball in April and Other Stories</h2><p>The Mexican American author Gary Soto draws on his own experience of growing up in California&#x2019;s Central Valley in this finely crafted collection of eleven short stories that reveal big themes in the small events of daily life.

He lives in Connecticut.PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;As a young black boy is tucked into bed, he imagines both the ordinary and extraordinary things that might happen the next day. Popping with rhyme, humor, and imagination, the text takes readers from a mundane blue sky to a squirrel named Stu and Cousin Todd blowing a kazoo. Lane's mixed-media illustrations add vibrancy to each panel, lending a jazzy, infectious beat to Eggers's lines. Each stanza begins with the phrase "Tomorrow most likely" and rhymes, with the laughable exception of "Tomorrow most likely/something won't rhyme." Perspective plays a tremendous role in the art and text, which helps both the flow and repetition to stay interesting even for older readers. At times, Smith reveals only part of what is happening in a picture or shows the cityscape and then abruptly adjusts to reveal the full picture or zooms in on a detail in the verse. Playful metaphors, such as "you could eat a cloud," are simply fun when combined with the art. Ultimately, the zaniness wraps with the core message: "Tomorrow most likely/will be a great day/because you are in it" and encourages originality and creativity in children. VERDICT Highly recommended for all collections; an outstanding storytime selection.&#x2014;Rachel Zuffa, Case High School, Racine, WI</p><h2>Build a Rental Property Empire: The no-nonsense book on finding deals, financing the right way, and managing wisely.

Dav was so disruptive in class that his teachers made him sit out in the hall every day. Luckily, Dav loved to draw and make up stories, so he spent his time in the hallway creating his own original comic books. In the second grade, Dav Pilkey created a comic book about a superhero named Captain Underpants. His teacher ripped it up and told him he couldn&#x2019;t spend the rest of his life making silly books. Fortunately, Dav was not a very good listener. Dav has gone on to create award-winning and bestselling books for children. His Captain Underpants series has more than 80 million copies in print worldwide and has been translated into more than 28 languages.

Kent Hughes,&nbsp;</strong>Senior Pastor Emeritus, College Church, Wheaton, Illinois</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Knowing the Bible</em> brings together a gifted team of Bible teachers to produce a high quality series of study guides. The coordinated focus of these materials is unique: biblical content, provocative questions, systematic theology, practical application, and the gospel story of God&#x2019;s grace presented all the way through Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Philip Graham Ryken,</strong> President, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;These <em>Knowing the Bible</em> volumes introduce a significant and very welcome variation on the general run of inductive Bible studies. Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers! The organization and structure of the Bible study format presented through the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series is so well conceived. Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A. Ware,</strong>&nbsp;T.

A friend who shares. A friend who listens. Maybe even a friend who likes things to stay the same and all in order, as Henry does. But on a day full of <em>too close</em> and <em>too loud</em>, when nothing seems to go right, will Henry ever find a friend&#x2014;or will a friend find him? With insight and warmth, this heartfelt story from the perspective of a boy on the autism spectrum celebrates the everyday magic of friendship.</p><p>Jenn Bailey is an author, editor, documentarian, blue-ribbon pie baker, and eager traveler. She lives in Kansas City, Missouri. This is her first picture book.<br><br>Mika Song is a children's writer and illustrator. She grew up in Manila, Philippines, and Honolulu, Hawaii, before moving to New York, where she worked as an animator prior to making children's books. She lives in New York City.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Henry is looking for a friend who is quiet, shares, and likes to read. Making friends can be difficult for anyone, but it is especially hard for Henry. He misreads social situations, believing that because a classmate has rainbow-painted nails, she would enjoy having her shoes painted. He lines the reading carpet squares up perfectly and melts down when another classmate's rambunctious, imaginative play disrupts the squares. One by one, classmates are ruled out as potential friends&#x2014;until Katie. Katie is quiet and likes to read, too. However, Katie slides down the big slide, something Henry would never do. Still, the two bond over their love for the class fish, and Henry takes a chance and asks Katie to play with him. They play together both indoors and out, leading Henry to the realization that friends don't have to be exactly alike to appreciate each other. The ink-and-watercolor illustrations show a diverse classroom. Henry is Asian and Katie is African American. It is never stated that Henry has autism, but his actions and thought processes will be familiar to readers who know someone on the autism spectrum. VERDICT A simple, upbeat story that might inspire readers to seek out friendship, and a good addition to general picture book collections.&#x2014;Kelly Roth, Bartow County Public Library, Cartersville, GA</p><h2>Guide to California Backroads &amp; 4-Wheel Drive Trails (FunTreks Guidebooks)</h2><p>Full color throughout 100 Trails over 500 photos, 232 pages. <br><br>This book replaces two previous black-and-white books that were written over a decade ago.

She started her teaching career in the 1980s as a primary school teacher in rural Australia. She then moved to Melbourne and taught at a number of inner-city schools. In 1985, Jay had a change of career and became an educational editor and publisher. In the early 90s, Jay and her partner moved to Japan to work as English teachers. They lived and worked in Japan for over three and a half years. In fact, Jay's first daughter was born there. On returning to Australia, Jay began work as an educational author/packager. Since that time, she has authored and produced numerous award-winning titles for the educational publishing industry. Jay is also an accomplished children's book author, writing a number of titles for such literacy series as ZigZags, Totally Kidz, Deadly and Incredible, and a children's picture book series for Penguin. She is currently working with an educational publisher as lead author of a literacy series. Jay has written over 100 titles in that series. Jay is a mother of three daughters and was a school councillor at her local school for over seven years. This time spent in schools both as a teacher and a parent inspired her to ask the question of her community: 'What are we doing in schools to protect our children from unsafe touch?' When she realised very little was actually being done, she decided to use her authoring and publishing skills to write Some Secrets Should Never Be Kept to help parents, carers and teachers to broach the subject of self-protection and to encourage children to speak up. After the encouraging response to Some Secrets Should Never Be Kept, she realised there was a need to further build upon the idea of children not keeping secrets about unsafe touch. Jay participated in Protective Behaviours professional development and attended numerous conferences on the topic to educate herself in how to keep children safe and provide them with prevention education. Jay then went on to develop and publish a comprehensive Body Safety and Respectful Relationship Teacher's Resource Kit as well as writing several more children's books on the topics of Body Safety, consent, respect, body boundaries and gender equality. Jay's ongoing passion for the safety and empowerment of children continues today with new manuscripts and free-to-download Body Safety resources always in the wings.<br><br>Since I was little that I've always had an enthusiastic urge to create.

Eric has authored or co-authored several books including the best-selling church leadership book, <i>Simple Church</i>. He is married to Kaye, and they have two daughters, Eden and Evie.Based on a study of 88 churches, this production discusses the concept of simplicity as it relates to spirituality. The authors compare church attendance to inviting guests into one's home. In a melodious baritone, Grover Gardner delivers their description of how guests arrive in the entryway, which is like the church foyer. They then liken guests in the living room to church attendees sitting in pews for a sermon. When the house guests become friends, they say, they're invited into the kitchen, and they liken that to attendees joining the church and becoming involved with the ministry. Gardner narrates with full attention to details as he interprets the authors' urging that churches return to simple methods of sharing the gospel.

Their quest takes them to major world cities, where they learn of their family heritage as Egyptian magicians who seek to destroy evil forces throughout civilization. The book has a cinematic feel, with excellent aerial shots, images revealed from unique points of view, and action delineated by slanted panels. The full-color art has a slick, luminous quality, enhancing the magical elements. Color is used to excellent advantage. For example, historical images in monochromatic shades of silver, copper, and blue visually distinguish the old kingdoms. Judicious use of red text reinforces the evil voice of Sekhmet. The powerful superhero quality is evident throughout the tale, where gods and goddesses resemble superheroes. Women move like superheroes, especially Bast, who claims "Combat magic is my specialty." Contests between warring powers, the scorpion sequence, the appearance of Sekhmet, and the boat traversing the cataract all crackle with action. Occasionally, some of the changes in layout, such as a full-page horizontal spread of selected panels, abruptly interrupt the narrative flow and make following the story confusing. Still, readers will eagerly identify with Carter when he declares, "It was a fight to the death and I felt great." This action adventure is jam-packed with ancient Egyptian culture and mythology, and will captivate young readers.-Barbara M.

He began&nbsp;his career as a hired British sailor during Queen Anne&#x2019;s War. He eventually settled in the Bahamas under Captain Benjamin Hornigold who taught the young sailor to go "a-pirating." Soon enough, Blackbeard was commanding his own fleet and stealing ships around the Caribbean and up and down the Eastern seaboard. Known for his thick, black beard and fearsome reputation, the legend of Blackbeard has influenced pirate legend and lore for over 300 years.</p><p>James Buckley, Jr. has written more than 50 books for kids, including&nbsp;<i>Who Was Ernest Shackleton?</i>Who Was Blackbeard?<br> &nbsp;<br> By 1717, Philadelphia was one of the largest cities in the American colonies, which were owned by Great Britain. Philadelphia was on the Delaware River, and its port welcomed ships from Europe almost every day. But in the fall of that year, many of those ships never made it to port. The few that did told tales that shocked and frightened the English colonists in and around Philadelphia. A pirate ship was lurking nearby in the Atlantic Ocean, where the Delaware met the sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> Captains arriving in New York City and Baltimore told the same stories. A pirate was attacking their ships. He swooped in with his black flag flying. His men stormed merchant ships and stole everything that wasn&#x2019;t nailed down.<br> &nbsp;<br> The pirate captain himself had a long black beard and wore belts rigged with pistols and<br> swords. He wore lit pieces or rope in his beard so that his face was ringed by smoke. His vessel was equipped with cannons that sent iron balls smashing into the fragile sides of wooden ships. Only a brave few would dare to challenge him and his ferocious crew.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If speedy care be not taken they will become formidable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our government can make no defense,&#x201d; wrote Philadelphia merchant James Logan. Captain Charles Johnson later wrote that the pirate had &#x201c;frightened America more than any comet that has appeared in a long time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This pirate was causing panic and fear throughout the American colonies. He continued his raids of terror down the Atlantic coast and into the Caribbean Sea. The people that he robbed and captured didn&#x2019;t know it at the time, but they were in the hands of the man who would become the most famous pirate ever: Blackbeard!</p><h2>Tokyo Ghoul, Vol. 9 (9)</h2><p>Ghouls live among us, the same as normal people in every way&#x2014;except their craving for human flesh.&nbsp;<br><br>Ghouls live among us, the same as normal people in every way&#x2014;except their craving for human flesh.

The original version, which sold more than 400,000 copies, is a curriculum staple in Bible schools worldwide. Now, in this new, beautifully bound hardback volume you will find: * 512 pages of reedited text * 16 pages of full-color illustrations (exclusively available in the print version. Not available in eBook). * Questions at the end of each chapter to guide you into deeper study In Dressed To Kill, Rick explains with exacting detail the purpose and function of each piece of Roman armor. In the process, he describes the significance of our spiritual armor not only to withstand the onslaughts of the enemy and but also to overturn the tendencies of the carnal mind. Furthermore, Rick delivers a clear, scriptural presentation on the biblical definition of spiritual warfare - what it is and what it is not. He stresses, &#34;Your unbroken, ongoing fellowship with God is your absolute guarantee that you are constantly and habitually dressed in the whole armor of God.&#34; When you walk with God in deliberate, continual fellowship, He will enrobe you with Himself. Armed with the knowledge of who you are in Him, you will be dressed and dangerous to the works of darkness, unflinching in the face of conflict, and fully equipped to take the offensive and gain mastery over any opposition from your spiritual foe.</p><p>Spiritual battles are just like natural battles. Nations don't constantly engage in warfare; they fight when a problem comes along. Afterward, their soldiers return home, experience a time of peace and refreshing, and don't fight again until there is a reason to fight.<br><br>The same is true with biblical spiritual warfare. Battles will come, but they won't come every day. God has given us spiritual weaponry so that when battles do come, we will be prepared to maintain our victorious position over Satan.<br><br>This book was written with this principle in mind. The teaching contained within these pages is not designed to make you run around looking for the devil behind every door. Rather, it is designed to help equip you so that when battles do come, you will be prepared to stand against them.<b>A Classic on Spiritual Warfare</b><br><br><i>Dressed To Kill</i> is a classic volume that has become a defining work in the arena of biblical spiritual warfare. Over the years, Bible schools, churches, scholars, and pastors have relied on this solid, scriptural presentation of true spiritual warfare as a measuring line for truth regarding this crucial &nbsp;yet often-misunderstood subject. <br><br>In this book, Rick provides an in-depth study of Roman armor, giving us unique insight into the purpose of spiritual armor in the lives of believers. This updated, reedited hardback edition of&nbsp; <i>Dressed To Kill</i> also includes a full-color insert of illustrations depicting every piece of armor the Roman soldier wore in preparation for battle. <br><br><i>Dressed To Kill</i> presents a scripturally sound, strategic approach to thwart every onslaught of <br>spiritual wickedness. The truths contained within its pages will help you discover both your ability and your responsibility to enforce Satan's defeat at Calvary so you can walk out God's perfect plan for your life.</p><h2>Modern Method for Guitar (Volume 1)</h2><p>A practical and comprehensive guitar method designed for the serious student. Develops technique in both hands as the student learns to read music.</p><p></p><h2>The Original Horse Bible: The Definitive Source for All Things Horse (CompanionHouse Books) 175 Breed Profiles, Training Tips, Riding Insights, Competitive Activities, Grooming, and Health Remedies</h2><p>The most comprehensive single volume dedicated to horses, The Original Horse Bible is a celebration of the long relationship that humans and horses enjoy, written by two highly regarded horsewomen, the late Moira C. Allen and Sharon Biggs. This 480-page volume, elaborately illustrated by world-renowned horse photographer Bob Langrish, is divided into eleven sections, covering topics that span the world of horses, from evolution and domestication to horse riding, training, competitions and more.<br> <br>Section 1: History, Physiology, and Behavior&#x201d; discusses the natural history of the horse, including adaption, migration, and domestication, how horses became integral to human kind, the role of horses in society (war horses, law-enforcement horses, race horses), as well as animal welfare and the plight of wild and feral horses. The anatomy and physiology of the horse are detailed in discussions of the horse&#x2019;s bodily systems, structure, senses, gait/movement, and coat and color patterns. In terms of behavior, the authors discuss the life cycle of the horse and reproduction, intelligence and trainability, and horse mentality and natural instincts.<br> <br>In Section 2: Breeds and Types,&#x201d; the authors trace the evolution of modern horse types from three known ancient ancestors and archaic types and extinct breeds. They describe the modern types of horses based on their particular looks and specific uses (Baroque, Cob, Hack, Hunter, Polo Pony and so forth). A detailed discussion of horse color follows, explaining the differences between each and what specific characteristics define each (buckskin, palomino, and pinto).<br> <br>The extensive breed chapter offers portraits of approximately 175 breeds, alphabetically arranged, from the Abaco Barb to the Welsh Pony, including many rare and handsome breeds from around the world as well as favorites like the American Quarter Horse, the Shetland Pony and the Thoroughbred. Main entries provide alternative names, region of origins, brief history, and physical descriptions for each breed. Sidebars called Breed in Brief&#x201d; offer concise overviews of the lesser known breeds.<br> <br>The popular hobby of horse riding is the focus of Section 3: Activities with Horses,&#x201d; which describes English, western, and driving competition as well as rodeo, competitive trail riding, vaulting, polo, and other horse sports. Section 7: Rider Instruction&#x201d; continues the discussion on riding with chapters on riding instructions, safety and fitness as well as English and western riding skills.<br> <br>In Section 4: A New Horse&#x201d; and Section 5 Horsekeeping,&#x201d; the Bible becomes a primer for all horse owners offering detailed information about choosing the right horse for novice riders, families, and experienced riders and purchasing the horse and the proper equipment (saddles and bridles, boots, gear, and gadgets). The section concludes with chapters on transporting horses, stabling and boarding, and feeding and grooming. Section 6: Health&#x201d; discusses veterinary care and vaccines, recognizing the signs of a healthy animal, first aid for each area of the horse&#x2019;s anatomy, hoof care, and winter wear. A complete chapter is dedicated to battling parasites and pests and avoiding poisonous plants in the horse&#x2019;s environment. A chapter on alternative care completes the section.<br> <br>Section 8:&#x201d;Horse Training&#x201d; focuses on various training philosophies and early handling, training lessons, solving training problems (leading, bolting, biting/nipping, rearing/buckling and shying).<br> <br>Section 9: Competition&#x201d; is dedicated to horse shows and classes, preparation for various kinds of shows for both the horse and the rider, and what to expect at the show. These chapters are filled with priceless firsthand advice and pointers from the authors about how to succeed at each of these events.<br> <br>Section 10: Breeding Mares and Raising Foals&#x201d; offers a complete overview of the reproduction of horses, with details on choosing a stallion, live cover versus artificial insemination, pregnancy, delivery, and care, imprinting, and handling of the young. Section 11: The Senior Horse&#x201d; discusses the horse&#x2019;s golden years, signs of aging, nutrition and care, retirement from activities, and general care for aging animals. Horse owners will find symptoms and treatment for sixteen of the most common equine aliments (found in the appendix) to be of great utility, as are the resource section and complete index at the end of the volume.</p><p>Moira C.

Add the egg yolks, one at a time, mixing thoroughly after each addition. Sift the flour, cornmeal, and salt over the mixture and stir just until the dough comes together. Knead lightly on a floured surface until the dough is no longer sticky.</p> <p><b>By Mixer</b><br> Cream the butter and sugar with the paddle until well blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, beating thoroughly after each addition. Sift in the flour, cornmeal, and salt, and mix at low speed; continue mixing until the dough comes together. Knead lightly on a floured surface until the dough is no longer sticky.</p> <p><b>By Processor</b><br> Place the flour, cornmeal, salt, and sugar in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Cut the cold butter into small pieces and scatter over the flour. Process with three or four pulses until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Beat the egg yolks lightly. With the machine running, pour the egg yolks in a steady stream through the feed tube and process just until the dough comes together. You may need to add a little ice-cold water. Stop the machine as soon as the dough masses on top of the blade. Overprocessing will make a tough dough.</p> <p><b><i>Chilling.</i></b> Gather the dough into a ball, wrap it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 20 minutes to 1 hour.</p> <p><b>Filling</b><br> 2 cups (1 lb / 450 g) full-bodied red wine; a Barolo or cabernet sauvignon would be perfect<br> 1/4 cup (1.8 oz / 50 g) sugar<br> 3 whole cloves<br> 3 thin strips lemon zest<br> 3/4 to 1 teaspoon (0.06 to 0.1 oz / 2 to 2.5 g) ground cinnamon<br> Cornmeal or finely ground cookie or cake crumbs, for sprinkling (optional)<br> 3 large peeled cooking pears (2 lb / 900 g, weighed after peeling), cut into fat slices and then cut crosswise in half<br> 1 large egg, beaten, for the egg wash</p> <p>Heat the wine, sugar, cloves, lemon zest, and cinnamon to a boil in a nonreactive saucepan. Gently boil until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 15 minutes. Stir in the pears and cook over medium heat until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain the pears; discard the cloves, lemon peel, and cooking liquid. Cool to room temperature.</p> <p><b><i>Shaping.</i></b> Cut the dough in half and return half to the refrigerator. This is a very delicate dough. Lightly sprinkle flour on your work surface and then lay one or two pieces of plastic wrap on it. Put the dough on the plastic wrap and cover it with a second layer of plastic wrap. This protects the dough as you roll it with your rolling pin into a circle 1/4 inch thick. Butter ?an 8 1/2-inch tart pan very thoroughly. Remove the top layer of plastic, gently lift the dough up by the bottom piece of plastic wrap, and then carefully invert it into the prepared pan before removing the remaining plastic wrap. Trim the edge. Build up the edge of the bottom pastry with the trimmings rolled into one or two coils and flattened onto the edge, so that the edge is substantial enough for the top pastry to be attached.</p> <p><b><i>Filling and Top Crust.</i></b> I sometimes sprinkle a very little cornmeal or cookie or cake crumbs on the bottom of the tart shell to soak up the juices from the pears. Spoon the drained pears into the tart shell. Again using plastic wrap, roll out the remaining dough into a 1/4-inch-thick circle and place over the pan. Trim the overhanging dough, press the two edges together, and crimp decoratively. Lightly brush the pastry with the beaten egg.</p> <p><b><i>Baking.</i></b> Preheat the oven to 375�F. Bake until golden, 40 minutes. Cool on a rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p> <p></p><p></p><b>Carol Field</b>&nbsp;is the author of five cookbooks, <i>In Nonna&#x2019;s Kitchen</i>, <i>Focaccia</i>, <i>Italy in Small Bites</i>, <i>Celebrating Italy</i>, and <i>The Italian Baker</i>, as well as <i>The Hill Towns of Italy</i> and <i>Mangoes and Quince</i>, a novel.

They range from paper polyhedra to bristling buckyballs that are reminiscent of sea urchins&#x2014;to ornate flower-like spheres. <br><br>Each piece of paper is held by the tension of the other papers&#x2014;demonstrating the remarkable hidden properties of paper, which is at the same time flexible but also durable! <br><br>Author Byriah Loper has been creating modular origami sculptures for just five years, but in that time, he's pushed the upper limits of the art form with some of the most significant, most complex geometric paper constructions ever assembled. While many geo-modular origami artists focus on creating dense floral spheres, Byriah has pioneered the open, linear "wire frame" approach, which results in a very complex-looking model that reveals the interior of its form. He regularly exhibits his sculptures annually at the Origami USA convention in New York and was recently a featured artist at the "Surface to Structure" exhibition at the Cooper Union gallery in the East Village. <br><br>A great way to learn origami, the easy-to-follow diagrams and step-by-step instructions in this book show you how to fold the paper components and then assemble them to create 22 incredible models. Each model is a new challenge, and the paper sculptures you create look fantastic on your desk or shelf!</p><p><b>Byriah Loper</b> has folded origami for five years. His interest in origami art began with the discovery of a paper airplane calendar, which inspired him to model more complicated objects out of paper.

She lives in Southern California.</p><br><br>&nbsp;<b>Ronald Himler</b> is the award-winning illustrator of more than 75 books for children. He lives in the desert outside of Tuscon, Arizona and can be visited online at ronhimler.com<br> &nbsp;Kindergarten-Grade 3-- "My dad and I live in an airport . . . the airport is better than the streets." As they did in The Wall (Clarion, 1990), Bunting and Himler successfully present a difficult subject in picture book format. A small child narrates the facts of his homeless existence--sleeping sitting up, washing in the restroom, and above all, avoiding being noticed. The brief text runs through all his emotions from a matter-of-fact acceptance to a fierce longing that makes him angry at those who have homes. Using subdued watercolors, Himler conveys the vast, impersonal spaces through which father and son move. He often places them at the back or edge of the pictures, underscoring their need to go unnoticed. This is a serious story but not an overpoweringly grim one. There is a reassuring togetherness between father and son and although there isn't an easy, happy ending, it does conclude on a poignant yet believable note of hope. Both illustrator and author focus on giving the child's-eye view of the problem, and their skill makes this a first-rate picture book that deserves a place in all collections. --Karen James, Louisville Free Public Library, KY<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>ABC Touch &amp; Feel: B is for Bear: A Very First Book for the Baby You Love (ABC Books)</h2><p>This alphabet board book is perfect for babies and toddlers.

This is a book to be read and absorbed by any school leader desiring to shape strong, positive cultures."</p> --<b>Kent D. Peterson</b>, Emeritus Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison<br><br><p>"As we've come to expect, Dr. Muhammad is unflinchingly unapologetic regarding the hard truths of school culture. But, once again, he separates himself from so many who take the stage, admire the problems, and offer no solutions. Dr. Muhammad both diagnoses and prescribes. No magic bullet or easy fix, but hope in the form of choices that will shift our paradigms and create transformational results.

Williams</b>, Author, Speaker, and Consultant; Unfold the Soul <p>"The second time around is better than the first. Dr. Muhammad has done it again by reminding us in powerful, impactful ways that a positive school culture is where any type of school success starts.

At just five years old, I had books on Monet and Renoir, and my earliest memories are of drawing with my two sisters. We would lie on the floor and color for hours, with the sunlight streaming in through the big glass door and our crayons, pencils, watercolors, and giant pieces of paper splayed out around us. At some point, our grandfather gave us a professional set of Pentel markers, and they seemed like a rainbow in a box compared to the simple primary colors we&#x2019;d used up until then. Housed in a golden case, they were a beautiful object unto themselves, and the most fascinating thing about this rainbow was the multiple versions of the same colors&#x2014;warm blue and cool blue, a true red and a burgundy. The marker set expanded my color palette, and with all these tools at my fingertips, I became&nbsp;hooked.<br><br>As I got older, my color story expanded. Growing up on Cape Cod, I was drawn to the beach in the off-season: the quieter time of year when the individual softer, muted tones of the natural landscape are highlighted because of the limited color palette. This is where I learned to see the beauty of neutrals&#x2014;not your typical desaturated gray or tan but rather multicolored, chromatic neutrals, which I will teach you all about in this book.&nbsp;<br><br>Artists have long been drawn to the Cape because of its serenity, juxtaposed with dramatic light. In the course of one day, the sand shifts from a soft, pale caramel to a bright cream at midday and, finally, to an ethereal glowing pink before the sun sets. There are infinite hues within these colors of sand, and within all of nature&#x2014;the sky, the sea, a field, or trees in the distance. There is always tonal variation, with the light picking up and highlighting the different textures in the landscape. I&nbsp;would sit on the beach, looking for these transformations and watching the waves coming in and going out, studying how the sky and water met at the horizon. I realized that this calm but colorful world was where I wanted to live.<br><br>Over time, my childhood predilection for drawing gave way to painting and making things with my hands. Painting became my greatest form of expression, and it&#x2019;s how I learned to understand color. I now recognize that I was attempting&nbsp;to mirror the beauty I saw in nature and the world around me. In middle school, I took a watercolor course where, in preparation for the class, we were given a shopping list of the &#x201c;basic&#x201d; colors we would need. We had a warm red and a cool red, as well as neutral hues like ochre and burnt sienna. I remember thinking, &#x201c;Who would want these bland, boring hues when there&#x2019;s blue and yellow?&#x201d; But through this class, and subsequent art lessons, I realized that these earth pigments are primers for creating a world that mimics nature and are building blocks for mixing hues. I was taught that when you&#x2019;re painting a landscape or a still life, you&#x2019;re re-creating how the light looks at a particular moment in time, and it subsequently shaped the way I think about color, art, and design.<br><br>I was so enamored with these concepts that studying fine art in college seemed like the natural next step, so after high school, I enrolled in Rhode Island School of Design as a painting major. I remember thinking that perhaps I should study something more &#x201c;practical,&#x201d; like business, but I had faith that I would be able to bring art into everyday life. Over time I&#x2019;ve realized that designing rooms and home goods was just like painting landscapes. With a room, you&#x2019;re making something out of nothing; you have to figure out which colors to use to achieve the feeling you want, and, just as in painting, neutrals are your base from which to build.<br><br>I graduated from RISD and began designing products for different companies, but with time I yearned to create art pieces for the home that felt like the landscapes from my childhood and that made it easy to layer livable color. I wanted to make palettes that captured the subdued tones of the Cape and to allow customers to bring the beauty of nature into their homes. I believed the product should feel personal, and I liked the idea of controlling how it was being made. I spent a lot of time thinking about my personal story, collecting inspiration and focusing on the creative process, dreaming up pieces that felt different from anything I&#x2019;d seen. Instead of producing pieces in response to trends, I wanted to create home goods that could be paired together to make beautiful environments unto themselves. I studied color and never stopped being a student of nature and art, and I want to share all that I&#x2019;ve learned with you in this book.<br><br>About This Book<br><br>I begin Living with Color with the concept that color is alive. In Part One: Understanding Color, I&#x2019;ll introduce you to the world of color through a scientific lens because, before you can decide which paint color is right for your bedroom, it&#x2019;s important to know that color is about perception. It is constantly changing, and we all experience it differently. This is why colors are so open to interpretation and deeply associated with feelings. Part One also explains how colors interact with one another and why certain colors make us feel cool and others warm. In this section, we&#x2019;ll consider what feelings you want to perceive in different rooms of your home. There is fascinating science behind why a room makes you feel cozy or calm.<br><br>Once you understand that color isn&#x2019;t static, you open up to the idea that there are infinite tones of colors that change with the season and time of day. In Part Two: Feeling Color, we&#x2019;ll explore these connections as well as the relationships between color and the senses. Color is so visceral&#x2014;you can almost taste, touch, and smell it&#x2014;and here I&#x2019;ll allow space for your mind to wander, for your mouth to water, and for you to draw free associations with the color world.&nbsp;<br><br>In Part Three: Seeing Color, I&#x2019;ll share my personal color memories with you and invite you to wash yourself in each color of the rainbow, soak in its rich history, and use it in a palette with other colors. We&#x2019;ll end this part with tips for how to incorporate each color into your home in thoughtful, organic ways.<br><br>In Part Four: Living Color, we&#x2019;ll tour! I&#x2019;ll take you inside the homes and lives of those who are living with color and using it in breathtaking ways. From chromatic neutrals to bright bursts, we&#x2019;ll see color stories in action, alive in the homes of artists and friends.<br><br>Lastly, we&#x2019;ll connect with color on a personal level. Color and meaning are complicated but also inspiring and captivating. In Part Five: Finding Color, I&#x2019;ll ask you to create your own distinct color wheel using your knowledge, personal exploration, and inspiration to design a rainbow that tells your unique color story. In the final pages of the book, we&#x2019;ll explore the kind of landscape in which you want to live. We&#x2019;ll dive into your own color memories and swim around in your color world. We&#x2019;ll go on a color hunt, looking for magic in the mundane, and open our eyes to the infinite color that surrounds us each day in exciting ways. Noticing the beauty in the myriad greens in your neighbor&#x2019;s front lawn or the variations in the grays on the sidewalk will make you feel more engaged in life and appreciative on your morning commute.</p><h2>Ricky Ricotta&#39;s Mighty Robot vs. the Stupid Stinkbugs from Saturn (Ricky Ricotta&#39;s Mighty Robot #6)</h2><p><b>From Dav Pilkey, creator of Captain Underpants, and acclaimed artist Dan Santat, a thrilling friendship adventure with all-new full-color illustrations and mini-comics throughout!</b><br><br>Ricky Ricotta and his Mighty Robot are in another stinky situation!<br><br>Ricky's family is headed to Cousin Lucy's house for lunch -- how boring!

Dav was so disruptive in class that his teachers made him sit out in the hall every day. Luckily, Dav loved to draw and make up stories, so he spent his time in the hallway creating his own original comic books. In the second grade, Dav Pilkey created a comic book about a superhero named Captain Underpants. His teacher ripped it up and told him he couldn&#x2019;t spend the rest of his life making silly books. Fortunately, Dav was not a very good listener. Dav has gone on to create award-winning and bestselling books for children. His Captain Underpants series has more than 80 million copies in print worldwide and has been translated into more than 28 languages. In 2017, DreamWorks Animation brought the character to the silver screen in the feature film adaptation <i>Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie</i>, and Netflix is now streaming <i>The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants</i> TV show.

Almost all children wonder whether there are others exactly like them somewhere out in the universe, doing the same thing at exactly the same time. By playing with that idea while juxtaposing similarity and difference, Robinson creates an almost mystical Droste effect of a story that is all mirrors and windows for the group of various children who are offered portals to reach one another. He also creates a speculative world with its own logic, and an adventure that will both puzzle and amuse." -&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review<br><br>* "The simple geometry of Robinson's work comes alive in this expanse of wordless narrative. A fearless use of white space and an utter disregard of conventions of direction encourage readers to engage with the physical book as the story unfolds, touching and turning it as they literally take the narrative into their hands. A bright, open primer for Escher." -&nbsp;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review<br><br>* "Both beautiful and fanciful...vibrant shapes reminiscent of Paul Klee or Piet Mondrian fill the pages.... A work of art and celebration of childhood for all libraries." -&nbsp;<i>School Library Journal</i>, starred review<br><br>"The brightly colored illustrations pop against a pure white background. Children, some upright and some upside down, are shown in a variety of clothing and skin colors, partaking in various activities. Is this a parallel universe, or is it all a dream? Readers will decide, and a little blue mouse may help with the final decision." -&nbsp;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>"Our protagonist, a brown-skinned explorer with a headful of bouncy beaded braids (which fetchingly fall up as she first pokes her head through the portal where up is down) is clearly a fan of other worlds (her nightie sports a red image of Saturn in complement to the mirror girl&#x2019;s blue, and she&#x2019;s looking into a telescope on the back cover) who&#x2019;s made for exploring, and her cat&#x2019;s silent but determined progress provides an entertaining visual thread. The youngest viewers may enjoy decoding the girl&#x2019;s journey with some adult assistance, while more book-savvy kids will get a kick out of 'reading' the story all on their own." -- BCCB<br><br>* "Smart, sly, and imaginative." -&nbsp;<i>Horn Book Magazine</i>, starred review<br><br>"In this exhilarating wordless picture book, a girl and her cat enter a portal to a physically skewed world where they encounter, among other things, their doppelg�ngers." -&nbsp;<i>Shelf Awareness</i><br><br>* A "multilayered, mind-blowing and truly out-of-this-world adventure." - <i>BookPage,&nbsp;</i>starred review</p><h2>Injustice Gods Among Us Year Three: The Complete Collection</h2><p>As action-packed as the video game phenomenon that inspired it, this graphic novel collects the entirety of the third year of the now-legendary <i>Injustice: Gods Among Us </i>saga that sees Superman and Batman rallying forces against each other!<br> &nbsp;<br> There was a great and terrible war between heroes.

The bond and covenant of marriage was established by God in creation, and our Lord Jesus Christ adorned this&nbsp; manner of life by his presence and first miracle at a wedding in Cana of Galilee. . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And so the ceremony begins.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is a ritual ancient as time and young as the hearts of the man and woman standing before us. (These brides and grooms look younger every year.) John is officiating. The bride and groom are dear friends. They are in love. We, their family and friends, are here to support them, celebrate them, all dressed up in our Sunday best. The church is glowing with candlelight; the flowers are so lovely. The Groom looks terrified but happy; the Bride is nervous and radiant. Suddenly I wonder, Did I sit on the proper side? Was it Bride&#x2019;s side on the left, Groom&#x2019;s side on the right? Or the other way around? The bridesmaids are stunning. Oh dear. They won&#x2019;t be wearing those dresses ever again!<br>&nbsp;<br>John continues, &#x201c;The union of husband and wife in heart, body, and mind is intended by God for their mutual joy. . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He looks so handsome in a suit and tie. I remember how he looked on our wedding day in that fabulous black tux with tails. I hope he asks me to dance at the reception.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Therefore marriage is not to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently, deliberately, and in accordance with the purposes for which it was instituted by God.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The liturgy begins to settle us in. The church quiets, the coughing<br>subsides, people are paying attention.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Who gives this woman to be married to this man?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>No matter how many weddings I attend, there is something inexplicably stirring about all this&#x2014; the ceremony, the making of vows, the great cloud of witnesses, something about this remarkable act feels. How does one describe it? Mythic.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Daniel and Megan, you are about to abandon yourselves to each other, throw caution to the wind, forsake independence, isolation and all others. You will vow to each other your undying love. Before you do, we must call this what it is&#x2014; this is perfect madness.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>That got the crowd&#x2019;s attention.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;As an aspiration, how lovely. As a reality, how rare. Everyone wants love; everyone is looking for love. Few seem to find what they are looking for; fewer still seem able to sustain it. Why in heaven&#x2019;s name would you come to church to publicly dedicate yourselves to something so risky, so fraught with danger, so scandalous? &#x2018;The heart has its reasons,&#x2019; Pascal confessed, &#x2018;that reason knows not of.&#x2019; Deep in the wellspring of our hearts there is a desire&#x2014; for intimacy, beauty, and adventure. And no matter what anyone might say, we look for it all the days of our lives.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Friends, I know what you are thinking. As you watch this today, there is something in your heart that says, &#x2018;Well, maybe. Maybe this time. Maybe this couple.&#x2019; But what if, what if Daniel and Megan, in all their frail humanity, are living out before us right now a picture, a metaphor of something far more real and substantial. I&#x2019;d like to suggest that this no common passion play. Things are never what they seem. If you would see things clearly you must see with the eyes of the heart. That is the secret of every fairy tale, because it is the secret to the Gospel, because it is the secret to life.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Scripture tells us that we might at any time entertain an angel simply by welcoming a stranger. The serpent in the garden is really the Prince of Darkness. The carpenter from Nazareth&#x2014; there is more to him than meets the eye as well. Things are not what they<br>seem, and so if we would understand our lives&#x2014; and especially our marriages&#x2014; we must listen again to the Gospel and the fairy tales based upon it. There are larger events unfolding around us, events of enormous consequence. A lamp is lit and love is lost. A box is opened and evil swarms into the world. An apple is taken and mankind is plunged into darkness. Moments of immense consequence are taking place all around us. Especially this.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Dearly Beloved, you see before you a man and a woman. But there is more here than meets the eye. God gave to us this passion play to reenact, right here and now, the story of the ages. This is the story of mankind, the one story we have been telling ourselves over and over again, in every great myth and legend and poem and song. It is a love story, set in the midst of desperate times, set in the midst of war. It is a story of a shared quest. It is a story of romance. Daniel and Megan are playing out before you now the deepest and most mythic reality in the world. This is the story of God&#x2019;s romance with mankind.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m curious what the audience is thinking. When John speaks of love and marriage as deeper than fairy tale, what does our heart say in reply? I know the young women listening just said in their hearts, <i>Oh I hope that is true! I long for that to be true!</i> The young men are wondering, <i>If that is true, what is this going to require of me?</i> The older women filter this through the years of our actual marital experience; they are thinking, <i>Hmmm.</i> (It is a mixture of <i>Yes, I once longed for that</i>, and, <i>Perhaps it will come true for her; I wonder if it still might come true for me.</i>) And the older men sitting here now are simply thinking, I wonder if the reception will have an open bar?<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t believe me,&#x201d; John says. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s because we don&#x2019;t understand fairy tales and we don&#x2019;t understand the Gospel which they are trying to remind us of. They are stories of danger; they are stories where evil is very, very real. They are stories which require immense courage and sacrifice. A boy and a girl thrown together in some desperate journey. If we believed it, if we actually saw what was taking place right here, right now, we would cross ourselves. We would say desperate prayers, earnest prayers. We would salute them both and we would hold our breath for what happens next. Daniel and Megan, it is time to make your vows. After this, there is no turning back.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I find myself wondering, What did the ancients know, that they placed vows at the core of this ceremony? Did they understand that the crushing weight of all our desire would break a marriage, that we needed something far more substantial to secure this frail union? It makes me think of the Special Forces, vowing their lives to one another as they embark on a perilous mission in dark lands, the outcome of which remains quite uncertain. Vows.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;. . . from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to have and to hold, to love and to cherish, till death do us part, according to God&#x2019;s holy ordinance, and forsaking all others, I will be yours alone as long as we both shall live.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The church is now very, very quiet. Only the older couples have any idea what these lovebirds have just promised, bless their hearts. They really believe that their marriage will somehow avert the darker side of the pledge; surely what they have in mind now is all their hopes and dreams of the &#x201c;for better, richer, in health&#x201d; parts. We all believed that. But Cortes has just burned his ships, and a good thing, too.<br>&nbsp;<br>Next comes the rings, and John&#x2019;s charge to the couple. I love this part. What do you say to the young man entering marriage? What do you say to the young woman?<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Daniel, you are about to give your life away. You are stepping up, you are volunteering for the toughest assignment a man will ever be given: To offer your heart and your strength to Megan, time and time and time again, for the rest of your days. You have some sense of the weightiness of it. That&#x2019;s why you have that nervous grin on your face.<br>But there was a reason they chose young men to send to the beaches at Normandy; they did not for the most part know what was coming. Older men would have been harder to recruit. I will not lie to you&#x2014;nothing will be harder. And nothing will be richer. My words to you today are: It can be done. And it is worth it. To discover that because of your strength and your sacrifice Megan can become the woman she was meant to be, that somehow your fierce love can free her heart and release her beauty&#x2014; that is worth what ever this may cost you. By the grace of God, you can do this. You have what it takes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Megan, you have dreamed of this day for a long, long time. And now you, also, are about to give your life away. It might seem easy and natural at first, to offer your feminine heart and your vulnerable beauty to Daniel. But do not be deceived. Nothing requires more courage than for a woman to truly offer herself to her man time and time and time again. Look around. Do you see many older women risking this? But I also say to you: It can be done. And it is worth it. To discover that because of your beauty and your sacrifice Daniel can become the man he was meant to be, that somehow your fierce love can free his heart and arouse his strength&#x2014; that is worth what ever this may cost you. By the grace of God, you can do this. You are that beautiful woman.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Daniel, Megan, in choosing marriage you have chosen an assignment at the frontlines in this epic battle for the human heart. You will face hardship, you will face suffering, you will face opposition, and you will face a lie. The scariest thing a woman ever offers is to believe that she is worth pursuing, to open her heart up to pursuit, to continue to open up her heart and offer the beauty she holds inside, all the while fearing it will not be enough. The scariest thing a man ever chooses is to offer his strength without knowing how things will turn out. To take the risk of playing the man before the outcome is decided. To offer his heart of strength while fearing it will not be enough.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;A lie is going to come to both of you, starting very soon, in subtle and not- so-subtle ways. It can&#x2019;t be done. It&#x2019;s too hard. We had unrealistic expectations. It isn&#x2019;t worth it. The lie to you, Megan, will be, &#x2018;You are nothing more than a disappointment.&#x2019; And the lie to you, Daniel, will be, &#x2018;You are not really man enough for this.&#x2019; And so, I have two words for you today. Words that I want you to keep close in your hearts as you go forward: You are. Megan, you are radiant, you shimmer, you shine, you are a treasure of a woman, a gem, you are. Daniel, you are a man, you are strong, and you are valiant. You have what it takes. Hold this close to your hearts. It can be done. And it is worth it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>John pauses to let this all sink in. I know what he is doing&#x2014; he is speaking to us, to the men and women watching, far more than to dear Daniel and Megan who are too excited, and weary, filled with adrenaline and hormones and somewhat delirious by this point that they will only remember these words if they watch the tape later. Like premarital counseling, so much of the wisdom of this moment cannot be appreciated until we have a few years of &#x201c;life together&#x201d; under our belts. Then we have ears to hear. So John pauses for us to take it all in. A breeze blows through the sanctuary. The candles flicker in reply with a higher flame. I hope that is what is happening in every heart. May the fire within each of our hearts leap to the hope of this message.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then he prays. We need to pray by this point; we have been practically holding our breath. We need a release for the tension and somewhere deep in our souls we know help is needed from higher places.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Father, we believe in you. We believe you are God, the creator of life and love and the only one who makes it all possible. We come to you, more desperate than we know, to ask your Presence here, your favor upon Daniel and Megan, to ask your deepest blessing upon their marriage. Give them courage. Give them a clear heart and mind and will for all that they have just now pledged. And give to us, their witnesses, eyes to see and ears to hear what you are saying to each of us, through this passion play. Let hope arise. Let love prevail. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Then comes the kiss (okay, maybe I love this part the most, it&#x2019;s so romantic). And the presentation of the new couple. Cheers. Music. Somewhere in the heavens, I imagine trumpets sounding and white doves being released. How God must love this!<br>&nbsp;<br>As we join the recessional and walk out of the church into the warm summer evening, we are all caught up for a moment in a joyful sobriety. The timeless ritual, the courage and love of the young couple, and the deeper mythic story are having an effect upon us. As well they should. Desire is stirring within us. Longing calls to us. This is what we all were made for.<br>&nbsp;<br>A warm breeze swirls among the crowd, and we instinctively turn our faces into it. The exotic perfume of magnolia and jasmine are in the air, mingling with the music coming from the reception party. The words linger in our midst. Even the older couples sense the<br>beckoning. John and I are holding hands. I notice that a number of the couples are holding hands. It can be done. And it is worth it. Of all the things a man or woman need to hear about marriage, this is perhaps the most important of all. <br>&nbsp;<br>It can be done. <br>And it is worth it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Chapter 1 </b><br><b>Remembering What We Wanted</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><i>See!

The title derived from a work that Nietzsche himself had considered writing. After Nietzsche's breakdown in 1889, and the passing of control over his literary estate to his sister Elisabeth F�rster-Nietzsche, Nietzsche's friend Heinrich K�selitz, also known as Peter Gast, conceived the notion of publishing selections from his notebooks, using one of Nietzsche's simpler outlines as a guide to their arrangement. As he explained to Elisabeth on November 8, 1893: &#x201c;Given that the original title appears as: The Antichrist. Revaluation of All Values (and therefore not 'The first book of the revaluation of all values'), you may think that your brother at the time of his incipient madness, thought the book completed. ... Notwithstanding, the consequences of this revaluation must also be explicitly illustrated in the field of morality, philosophy, politics. No one today is able to imagine such consequences &#x2013; that's why the vast preparations by your brother, the other three books of the Revaluation, must be ordered according to my suggestion and gathered in a kind of system.&#x201d; Between 1894 and 1926, Elisabeth arranged the publication of the twenty volume Gro�oktavausgabe edition of Nietzsche's writings by C. G. Naumann. In it, following K�selitz' suggestion she included a selection from Nietzsche's posthumous fragments, which was gathered together and entitled The Will To Power. She claimed that this text was substantially the magnum opus, which Nietzsche had hoped to write and name "The Will to Power, An Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values". The first German edition, containing 483 sections, published in 1901, was edited by K�selitz, Ernst Horneffer, and August Horneffer, under Elisabeth's direction. This version was superseded in 1906 by an expanded second edition containing 1067 sections. This later compilation is what has come to be commonly known as The Will to Power.</p><p>Represents a selection from Nietzche&#39;s notebooks to find out what he wrote on nihilism, art, morality, religion, and the theory of knowledge, among others.The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was born in Prussia in 1844. After the death of his father, a Lutheran minister, Nietzsche was raised from the age of five by his mother in a household of women. In 1869 he was appointed Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Basel, where he taught until 1879 when poor health forced him to retire. He never recovered from a nervous breakdown in 1889 and died eleven years later. Known for saying that &#x201c;god is dead,&#x201d; Nietzsche propounded his metaphysical construct of the superiority of the disciplined individual (superman) living in the present over traditional values derived from Christianity and its emphasis on heavenly rewards. His ideas were appropriated by the Fascists, who turned his theories into social realities that he had never intended.</p><h2>Stranger Things: Zombie Boys (Graphic Novel)</h2><p><b>Following the events of season one of Netflix's pop-culture sensation <i>Stranger Things</i>, our main characters struggle with returning to normal life after overcoming supernatural horror.</b><br><br>School is back in session in the normally quiet town of Hawkins, Indiana.

Only the lady who gave utterance to the exclamation was not a duchess.<br><br>It was a day in early June. I had been transacting some business in Paris and was returning by the morning service to London, where I was still sharing rooms with my old friend, the Belgian ex-detective, Hercule Poirot.<br><br>The Calais express was singularly empty&#x2014;in fact, my own compartment held only one other traveller. I had made a somewhat hurried departure from the hotel and was busy assuring myself that I had duly collected all my traps, when the train started. Up till then I had hardly noticed my companion, but I was now violently recalled to the fact of her existence. Jumping up from her seat, she let down the window and stuck her head out, withdrawing it a moment later with the brief and forcible ejaculation &#x201c;Hell!&#x201d;<br><br>Now I am old-fashioned. A woman, I consider, should be womanly. I have no patience with the modern neurotic girl who jazzes from morning to night, smokes like a chimney, and uses language which would make a Billingsgate fishwoman blush!<br><br>I looked up, frowning slightly, into a pretty, impudent face, surmounted by a rakish little red hat. A thick cluster of black curls hid each ear. I judged that she was little more than seventeen, but her face was covered with powder, and her lips were quite impossibly scarlet.<br><br>Nothing abashed, she returned my glance, and executed an expressive grimace.<br><br>&#x201c;Dear me, we&#x2019;ve shocked the kind gentleman!&#x201d; she observed to an imaginary audience. &#x201c;I apologize for my language! Most unladylike, and all that, but, oh, Lord, there&#x2019;s reason enough for it! Do you know I&#x2019;ve lost my only sister?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; I said politely. &#x201c;How unfortunate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He disapproves!&#x201d; remarked the lady. &#x201c;He disapproves utterly&#x2014;of me, and my sister&#x2014;which last is unfair, because he hasn&#x2019;t seen her!&#x201d;<br><br>I opened my mouth, but she forestalled me.<br><br>&#x201c;Say no more! Nobody loves me! I shall go into the garden and eat worms! Boohoo. I am crushed!&#x201d;<br><br>She buried herself behind a large comic French paper. In a minute or two I saw her eyes stealthily peeping at me over the top. In spite of myself I could not help smiling, and in a minute she had tossed the paper aside, and had burst into a merry peal of laughter.<br><br>&#x201c;I knew you weren&#x2019;t such a mutt as you looked,&#x201d; she cried.<br><br>Her laughter was so infectious that I could not help joining in, though I hardly cared for the word &#x201c;mutt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There! Now we&#x2019;re friends!&#x201d; declared the minx. &#x201c;Say you&#x2019;re sorry about my sister&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am desolated!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good boy!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me finish. I was going to add that, although I am desolated, I can manage to put up with her absence very well.&#x201d; I made a little bow.<br><br>But this most unaccountable of damsels frowned and shook her head.<br><br>&#x201c;Cut it out. I prefer the &#x2018;dignified disapproval&#x2019; stunt. Oh, your face! &#x2018;Not one of us,&#x2019; it said. And you were right there&#x2014;though, mind you, it&#x2019;s pretty hard to tell nowadays. It&#x2019;s not everyone who can distinguish between a demi and a duchess. There now, I believe I&#x2019;ve shocked you again! You&#x2019;ve been dug out of the backwoods, you have. Not that I mind that. We could do with a few more of your sort. I just hate a fellow who gets fresh. It makes me mad.&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her head vigorously.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you like when you&#x2019;re mad?&#x201d; I inquired with a smile.<br><br>&#x201c;A regular little devil! Don&#x2019;t care what I say, or what I do, either! I nearly did a chap in once. Yes, really. He&#x2019;d have deserved it too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I begged, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t get mad with me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I shan&#x2019;t. I like you&#x2014;did the first moment I set eyes on you. But you looked so disapproving that I never thought we should make friends.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, we have. Tell me something about yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an actress. No&#x2014;not the kind you&#x2019;re thinking of. I&#x2019;ve been on the boards since I was a kid of six&#x2014;tumbling.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I beg your pardon,&#x201d; I said, puzzled.<br><br>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you ever seen child acrobats?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I understand!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m American born, but I&#x2019;ve spent most of my life in England. We&#x2019;ve got a new show now&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My sister and I. Sort of song and dance, and a bit of patter, and a dash of the old business thrown in. It&#x2019;s quite a new idea, and it hits them every time. There&#x2019;s going to be money in it&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>My new acquaintance leaned forward, and discoursed volubly, a great many of her terms being quite unintelligible to me. Yet I found myself evincing an increasing interest in her. She seemed such a curious mixture of child and woman. Though perfectly worldly-wise, and able, as she expressed it, to take care of herself, there was yet something curiously ingenuous in her single-minded attitude towards life, and her wholehearted determination to &#x201c;make good.&#x201d;<br><br>We passed through Amiens. The name awakened many memories. My companion seemed to have an intuitive knowledge of what was in my mind.<br><br>&#x201c;Thinking of the War?&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;You were through it, I suppose?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pretty well. I was wounded once, and after the Somme they invalided me out altogether. I&#x2019;m a sort of private secretary now to an MP.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My! That&#x2019;s brainy!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, it isn&#x2019;t. There&#x2019;s really awfully little to do. Usually a couple of hours every day sees me through. It&#x2019;s dull work too. In fact, I don&#x2019;t know what I should do if I hadn&#x2019;t got something to fall back upon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say you collect bugs!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. I share rooms with a very interesting man. He&#x2019;s a Belgian&#x2014;an ex-detective. He&#x2019;s set up as a private detective in London, and he&#x2019;s doing extraordinarily well. He&#x2019;s really a very marvellous little man. Time and again he has proved to be right where the official police have failed.&#x201d;<br><br>My companion listened with widening eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that interesting now? I just adore crime. I go to all the mysteries on the movies. And when there&#x2019;s a murder on I just devour the papers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you remember the Styles Case?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Let me see, was that the old lady who was poisoned? Somewhere down in Essex?&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;That was Poirot&#x2019;s first big case. Undoubtedly, but for him the murderer would have escaped scot-free. It was a most wonderful bit of detective work.&#x201d;<br><br>Warming to my subject, I ran over the heads of the affair, working up to the triumphant and unexpected d�nouement.<br><br>The girl listened spellbound. In fact, we were so absorbed that the train drew into Calais station before we realized it.<br><br>I secured a couple of porters, and we alighted on the platform. My companion held out her hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Good-bye, and I&#x2019;ll mind my language better in future.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, but surely you&#x2019;ll let me look after you on the boat?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mayn&#x2019;t be on the boat. I&#x2019;ve got to see whether that sister of mine got aboard after all anywhere. But thanks, all the same.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, but we&#x2019;re going to meet again, surely? Aren&#x2019;t you even going to tell me your name?&#x201d; I cried, as she turned away.<br><br>She looked over her shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;Cinderella,&#x201d; she said, and laughed.<br><br>But little did I think when and how I should see Cinderella again.<br><br>� Two �<br><br>An Appeal for Help<br><br>It was five minutes past nine when I entered our joint sitting room for breakfast on the following morning. My friend Poirot, exact to the minute as usual, was just tapping the shell of his second egg.<br><br>He beamed upon me as I entered.<br><br>&#x201c;You have slept well, yes? You have recovered from the crossing so terrible? It is a marvel, almost you are exact this morning. Pardon, but your tie is not symmetrical. Permit that I rearrange him.&#x201d;<br><br>Elsewhere, I have described Hercule Poirot. An extraordinary little man! Height, five feet four inches, egg-shaped head carried a little to one side, eyes that shone green when he was excited, stiff military moustache, air of dignity immense! He was neat and dandified in appearance. For neatness of any kind he had an absolute passion. To see an ornament set crookedly, or a speck of dust, or a slight disarray in one&#x2019;s attire, was torture to the little man until he could ease his feelings by remedying the matter. &#x201c;Order&#x201d; and &#x201c;Method&#x201d; were his gods. He had a certain disdain for tangible evidence, such as footprints and cigarette ash, and would maintain that, taken by themselves, they would never enable a detective to solve a problem. Then he would tap his egg-shaped head with absurd complacency, and remark with great satisfaction: &#x201c;The true work, it is done from within. The little grey cells&#x2014;remember always the little grey cells, mon ami.&#x201d;<br><br>I slipped into my seat, and remarked idly, in answer to Poirot&#x2019;s greeting, that an hour&#x2019;s sea passage from Calais to Dover could hardly be dignified by the epithet &#x201c;terrible.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anything interesting come by the post?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>Poirot shook his head with a dissatisfied air.<br><br>&#x201c;I have not yet examined my letters, but nothing of interest arrives nowadays. The great criminals, the criminals of method, they do not exist.&#x201d;<br><br>He shook his head despondently, and I roared with laughter.<br><br>&#x201c;Cheer up, Poirot, the luck will change. Open your letters. For all you know, there may be a great case looming on the horizon.&#x201d;<br><br>Poirot smiled, and taking up the neat little letter opener with which he opened his correspondence he slit the tops of the several envelopes that lay by his plate.<br><br>&#x201c;A bill. Another bill. It is that I grow extravagant in my old age. Aha! a note from Japp.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; I pricked up my ears. The Scotland Yard Inspector had more than once introduced us to an interesting case.<br><br>&#x201c;He merely thanks me (in his fashion) for a little point in the Aberystwyth Case on which I was able to set him right. I am delighted to have been of service to him.&#x201d;<br><br>Poirot continued to read his correspondence placidly.<br><br>&#x201c;A suggestion that I should give a lecture to our local Boy Scouts. The Countess of Forfanock will be obliged if I will call and see her. Another lapdog without doubt! And now for the last. Ah&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>I looked up, quick to notice the change of tone. Poirot was reading attentively. In a minute he tossed the sheet over to me.<br><br>&#x201c;This is out of the ordinary, mon ami. Read for yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>The letter was written on a foreign type of paper, in a bold characteristic hand:<br><br>Villa Genevi�ve,<br><br>Merlinville-sur-Mer,<br><br>France.<br><br>Dear Sir,&#x2014;I am in need of the services of a detective and, for reasons which I will give you later, do not wish to call in the official police. I have heard of you from several quarters, and all reports go to show that you are not only a man of decided ability, but one who also knows how to be discreet. I do not wish to trust details to the post, but, on account of a secret I possess, I go in daily fear of my life. I am convinced that the danger is imminent, and therefore I beg that you will lose no time in crossing to France, I will send a car to meet you at Calais, if you will wire me when you are arriving. I shall be obliged if you will drop all cases you have on hand, and devote yourself solely to my interests. I am prepared to pay any compensation necessary. I shall probably need your services for a considerable period of time, as it may be necessary for you to go out to Santiago, where I spent several years of my life. I shall be content for you to name your own fee.<br><br>Assuring you once more that the matter is urgent.<br><br>Yours faithfully, <br><br>P. T. Renauld.<br><br>Below the signature was a hastily scrawled line, almost illegible:<br><br>&#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, come!&#x201d;<br><br>I handed the letter back with quickened pulses.<br><br>&#x201c;At last!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Here is something distinctly out of the ordinary.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, indeed,&#x201d; said Poirot meditatively.<br><br>&#x201c;You will go of course,&#x201d; I continued.<br><br>Poirot nodded. He was thinking deeply. Finally he seemed to make up his mind, and glanced up at the clock. His face was very grave.<br><br>&#x201c;See you, my friend, there is no time to lose. The Continental express leaves Victoria at 11 o&#x2019;clock. Do not agitate yourself. There is plenty of time. We can allow ten minutes for discussion. You accompany me, n&#x2019;est ce pas?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You told me yourself that your employer needed you not for the next few weeks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s all right. But this Mr. Renauld hints strongly that his business is private.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ta-ta-ta! I will manage M. Renauld. By the way, I seem to know the name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a well-known South American millionaire fellow. His name&#x2019;s Renauld. I don&#x2019;t know whether it could be the same.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But without doubt. That explains the mention of Santiago. Santiago is in Chile, and Chile it is in South America! Ah, but we progress finely! You remarked the postscript? How did it strike you?&#x201d;<br><br>I considered.<br><br>&#x201c;Clearly he wrote the letter keeping himself well in hand, but at the end his self-control snapped and, on the impulse of the moment, he scrawled those four desperate words.&#x201d;<br><br>But my friend shook his head energetically.<br><br>&#x201c;You are in error. See you not that while the ink of the signature is nearly black, that of the postscript is quite pale?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; I said, puzzled.<br><br>&#x201c;Mon Dieu, mon ami, but use your little grey cells. Is it not obvious? Mr. Renauld wrote his letter. Without blotting it, he reread it carefully. Then, not on impulse, but deliberately, he added those last words, and blotted the sheet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Parbleu! so that it should produce the effect upon me that it has upon you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mais oui&#x2014;to make sure of my coming! He reread the letter and was dissatisfied. It was not strong enough!&#x201d;<br><br>He paused, and then added softly, his eyes shining with that green light that always betokened inward excitement:<br><br>&#x201c;And so, mon ami, since that postscript was added, not on impulse, but soberly, in cold blood, the urgency is very great, and we must reach him as soon as possible.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Merlinville,&#x201d; I murmured thoughtfully. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard of it, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>Poirot nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;It is a quiet little place&#x2014;but chic! It lies about midway between Boulogne and Calais. Mr. Renauld has a house in England, I suppose?&#x201d;</p><h2>Naked Mole Rat Gets Dressed</h2><p><b>Handpicked by Amazon kids&#x2019; books editor, Seira Wilson, for Prime Book Box &#x2013; a children&#x2019;s subscription that inspires a love of reading.</b><br><br>Wilbur is different from the other Naked Mole Rats in his Colony, because <i>he</i> wears clothes (and he likes it!). But what will happen when Grandpah, the oldest, wisest, and most naked Naked Mole Rat ever discovers Wilbur's secret <br><br>Funnyman and three-time Caldecott Honoree Mo Willems exposes the naked truth about being yourself and wearing it well.</p><p>Number one <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author and illustrator <strong>Mo Willems</strong> started his career on <em>Sesame Street</em>, where he garnered six Emmy Awards for his writing before changing the face of children's literature with his groundbreaking picture books. Mo has been awarded a Caldecott Honor on three occasions (for <em>Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!</em>, <em>Knuffle Bunny: A Cautionary Tale</em>, and <em>Knuffle Bunny Too: A Case of Mistaken Identity</em>) and his acclaimed Elephant and Piggie early reader series received the Theodor Seuss Geisel Medal in 2008. He lives with his family in Brooklyn, New York.<br><br>same as above"These books will easily take their place alongside Seuss and Eastman as classics in the beginning-reader genre."<br><br>"The Pigeon . . . can stand toe-to-ideographic-toe with Mickey Mouse and Charlie Brown."<br><br>In the opening pages of this buoyant picture book, Willems (Knuffle Bunny) informs readers that "for this story" they need only know three things about naked mole rats: "1. They are a little bit rat. 2. They are a little bit mole. 3. They are all naked." The exception to point number three, however, is Wilbur, who revels in a wardrobe that ranges from a turtleneck and beret to an astronaut suit-infuriating his brethren. When the naked mole rats complain to their leader, Grand-pah, he gathers the colony and issues a proclamation. Happily for Wilbur, it's a call for tolerance. Willems is fully aware that nudity = comic gold for this audience, and his legion of emotive, square-headed rodents-far cuter than in real life-are paired successfully with droll prose ("Grand-pah did look heroic. Grand-pah did look regal. But he would also look heroic and regal in a casual shirt and some summer slacks"). Straightforward and engaging. PW"<br><br>Willems begins by giving us all the background we need about naked mole rats: "1. They are a little bit rat. 2. They are a little bit mole. 3. They are all naked." All except Wilbur, an earnest dandy who can't resist donning ties, jackets, pants, hats, or even entire superhero or astronaut getups. After all, the more outfits he has, the more he can pretend to be all sorts of different characters. Wilbur's nude friends are appalled and complain to the colony ruler, who unexpectedly decrees that, from here on, their colony will be clothingoptional. Soon everyone is crazily clad and snapping up duds from Wilbur's new clothing store. Willems' art follows the simple style of his Elephant and Piggie books, and is dominated in color by (no surprise) naked-mole-rat pink. An ongoing horizontal line lends continuity to most of the pages, occasionally curving to add simple architecture to the scenes. But mostly it is Wilbur's guileless observations that will have young readers feeling good about individual expression. Booklist"<br><br>There's one in every crowd, an iconoclast who won't follow the rules; in the case of naked mole rats, it's Wilbur, who just can't resist a natty suit and tie: "When the other naked mole rats saw him, they said; Eeeeeewwwww!' Yuck!' "What are you doing?" Wilbur, it seems, likes the versatility that clothing allows ("I can be fancy, or funny, or cool, or I can just be an astronaut"), but the other NMRs are scandalized and respond to Wilbur's desire for attire by ratting him out to Grand-pah, "the oldest, greatest, and most naked mole rat ever." After much thought, the wise Grand-pah issues a proclamation that all naked mole rats can dress, or not, as they like, prompting several to give apparel a go (give tees a chance?). Wilbur's tale is amusing in its own right, and there's plenty of humor in the inversion of usual kidly desires; Willems' writing is as humorously and cheerfully absurd as ever ("Grand-pah did look heroic. Grand-pah did look regal. But he would also look heroic and regal in a casual shirt and some summer slacks"). The little bucktoothed, box-jawed pink naked mole rats look, endearingly, a bit like biped pink hippos with overbites and tails (in fact, there's a slight suggestion of James Marshall's George and Martha), and Willems continues to be a master at conveying an amazing amount of emotion and humor using the minimal elements of his figures' dot eyes, dash eyebrows, and body language. Gently subversive in the way it questions the norm, Wilbur's story will please classroom rebels, Willems fans, and those who just like to giggle at the word "naked." BCCB"<br><br>Willems's contemporary fable concerns the way in which a young member of the species "naked mole rats" is different. As the nomenclature suggests, the group does not wear clothing, with the singular exception of Wilbur. His extensive wardrobe, ranging from a tuxedo to a space suit, and his insistence on wearing it, cause much consternation and criticism from his colony. At last, they consult Grand-pah, "the oldest, greatest, and most naked naked mole rat ever." He calls a town meeting. To everyone's surprise, particularly the protagonist's, Grand-pah arrives in a seersucker suit and waxes eloquent on the wisdom of Wilbur's simple question: "Why not?" Converts abound and a celebration ensues in which some dress up and some do not, but everyone has fun. Willems has a talent for creating funny lines, verbally and visually. Beige backgrounds provide an uncluttered stage for his pink creatures with their oversize rectangular heads, each conveying a distinctive personality. Much of the humor resides in the subtle changes in Wilbur's eyes and, of course, in his colorful costumes. Adults will embrace the message of tolerance, happy to have a tale that can be shared with young children. They will also appreciate the hints of Charles Schultz that surface here and there. Kids will giggle and wish their daily dramas had similar endings. Now, however, they'll have a script. SLJ"<br><br>Willems tackles the old it's-OK-to-be-different genre with his customary chutzpah and subversive charm. It is common knowledge that naked mole rats are just that: naked. Wilbur, however, is a strange fellow who enjoys a nice set of clothes. Suffice it to say the other mole rats are shocked and horrified by his behavior. They mock him, show him heroic portraits of naked heroes and finally complain to the great Grand-pah, who is both very wise and very nude. But after some consideration, Grand-pah surprises everyone by proclaiming (while wearing a rather natty outfit of his own) that while clothes "may not be for everyone" they certainly can be fun. Willems eschews a black-and-white encouragement to stand out from the crowd, offering instead a story that makes a case for different opinions to operate side by side. There are some similarities to the Pigeon format (including the trademark temper tantrum, for instance), but otherwise this is a story that stands firmly on its two bare feet.

He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books. The Bond novels have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide, boosted by the hugely successful film franchise that began in 1962 with the release of <i>Dr. No</i>. </p><p>He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only son Caspar, went on to become the well- loved novel and film <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. </p><p>Fleming died of heart failure on August 12, 1964, at the age of fifty-six.</p><p>With its two fighting claws held forward like a wrestler's arms the big pandinus scorpion emerged with a dry rustle from the finger-sized hole under the rock.</p> <p>There was a small patch of hard, flat earth outside the hole and the scorpion stood in the centre of this on the tips of its four pairs of legs, its nerves and muscles braced for a quick retreat and its senses questing for the minute vibrations which would decide its next move.</p> <p>The moonlight, glittering down through the great thorn bush, threw sapphire highlights off the hard, black polish of the six-inch body and glinted palely on the moist white sting which protruded from the last segment of the tail, now curved over parallel with the scorpion's flat back. Slowly the sting slid home into its sheath and the nerves in the poison sac at its base relaxed. The scorpion had decided. Greed had won over fear.</p> <p>Twelve inches away, at the bottom of a sharp slope of sand, the small beetle was concerned only with trudging on towards better pastures than he had found under the thorn bush, and the swift rush of the scorpion down the slope gave him no time to open his wings. The beetle's legs waved in protest as the sharp claw snapped round his body, and then the sting lanced into him from over the scorpion's head and immediately he was dead.</p> <p>After it had killed the beetle the scorpion stood motionless for nearly five minutes. During this time it identified the nature of its prey and again tested the ground and the air for hostile vibrations. Reassured, its fighting claw withdrew from the half-severed beetle and its two small feeding pincers reached out and into the beetle's flesh. Then for an hour, and with extreme fastidiousness, the scorpion ate its victim.</p> <p>The great thorn bush under which the scorpion killed the beetle was quite a landmark in the wide expanse of rolling veld some forty miles south of Kissidougou in the south-western corner of French Guinea. On all horizons there were hills and jungle, but here, over twenty square miles, there was flat rocky ground which was almost desert and amongst the tropical scrub only this one thorn bush, perhaps because there was water deep beneath its roots, had grown to the height of a house and could be picked out from many miles away.</p> <p>The bush grew more or less at the junction of three African states. It was in French Guinea but only about ten miles north of the northernmost tip of Liberia and five miles east of the frontier of Sierra Leone. Across this frontier are the great diamond mines around Sefadu. These are the property of Sierra International, which is part of the powerful mining empire of Afric International, which in turn is a rich capital asset of the British Commonwealth.</p> <p>An hour earlier in its hole among the roots of the great thorn bush the scorpion had been alerted by two sets of vibrations. First there had been the tiny scraping of the beetle's movements, and these belonged to the vibrations which the scorpion immediately recognised and diagnosed. Then there had been a series of incomprehensible thuds round the bush followed by a final heavy quake which had caved in part of the scorpion's hole. These were followed by a soft rhythmic trembling of the ground which was so regular that it soon became a background vibration of no urgency. After a pause the tiny scraping of the beetle had continued, and it was greed for the beetle that, after a day of sheltering from its deadliest enemy, the sun, finally got the upper hand against the scorpion's memory of the other noises and impelled it out of its lair into the filtering moonlight.</p> <p>And now, as it slowly sucked the morsels of beetle-flesh off its feeding pincers, the signal for the scorpion's own death sounded from far away on the eastern horizon, audible to a human, but made up of vibrations which were far outside the range of the scorpion's sensory system.</p> <p>And, a few feet away, a heavy, blunt hand, with bitten finger nails, softly raised a jagged piece of rock. There was no noise, but the scorpion felt a tiny movement in the air above it. At once its fighting claws were up and groping and its sting was erect in the rigid tail, its near-sighted eyes staring up for a sight of the enemy.</p> <p>The heavy stone came down.</p> <p>'Black bastard.'</p> <p>The man watched as the broken insect whipped in its death agony.</p> <p>The man yawned. He got to his knees in the sandy depression against the trunk of the bush where he had been sitting for nearly two hours and, his arms bent protectingly over his head, scrambled out into the open.</p> <p>The noise of the engine which the man had been waiting for, and which had signed the scorpion's death warrant, was louder. As the man stood and stared up the path of the moon, he could just see a clumsy black shape coming fast towards him out of the east and for a moment the moonlight glinted on whirling rotor blades.</p> <p>The man rubbed his hands down the sides of his dirty khaki shorts and moved quickly round the bush to where the rear wheel of a battered motor-cycle protruded from its hiding place. Below the pillion, on either side, there were leather toolboxes. From one of these he extracted a small heavy package which he stowed inside his open shirt against the skin. From the other he took four cheap electric torches and went off with them to where, fifty yards from the big horns bush, there was a clear patch of flat ground about the size of a tennis court. At three corners of the landing ground he screwed the butt end of a torch into the ground and switched it on. Then, the last torch alight in his hand, he took up his position at the fourth corner and waited.</p> <p>The helicopter was moving slowly towards him, not more than a hundred feet from the ground, the big rotor blades idling. It looked like a huge, badly constructed insect. To the man on the ground it seemed, as usual, to be making too much noise.</p> <p>The helicopter paused, pitching slightly, directly over his head. An arm came out of the cockpit and a torch flashed at him. It flashed dot-dash, the morse for A.</p> <p>The man on the ground flashed back a B and a C. He stuck the fourth torch into the ground and moved away, shielding his eyes against the coming whirl of dust. Above him the pitch of the rotor blades flattened imperceptibly and the helicopter settled smoothly into the space between the four torches. The clatter of the engine stopped with a final cough, the tail rotor spun briefly in neutral, and the main rotor blades completed a few awkward revolutions and then drooped to a halt.</p> <p>In the echoing silence, a cricket started to zing in the thorn bush, and somewhere near at hand there was the anxious chirrup of a nightbird.</p> <p>After a pause to let the dust settle, the pilot banged open the door of the cockpit, pushed out a small aluminium ladder and climbed stiffly to the ground. He waited beside his machine while the other man walked round the four corners of the landing ground picking up and dowsing the torches. The pilot was half an hour late at the rendezvous and he was bored at the prospect of listening to the other man's inevitable complaint. He despised all Afrikaners. This one in particular. To a Reichsdeutscher and to a Luftwaffe pilot who had fought under Galland in defence of the Reich they were a bastard race, sly, stupid and ill-bred. Of course this brute had a tricky job, but it was nothing to navigating a helicopter five hundred miles over the jungle in the middle of the night, and then taking it back again.</p> <p>As the other man came up, the pilot half raised his hand in greeting. 'Everything all right?'</p> <p>'I hope so. But you're late again. I shall only just make it through the frontier by first light.'</p> <p>'Magneto trouble. We all have our worries. Thank God there are only thirteen full moons a year. Well, if you've got the stuff let's have it and we'll tank her up and I'll be off.'</p> <p>Without speaking, the man from the diamond mines reached into his shirt and handed over the neat, heavy packet.</p> <p>The pilot took it. It was damp with the sweat from the smuggler's ribs. The pilot dropped it into a side pocket of his trim bush shirt. He put his hand behind him and wiped his fingers on the seat of his shorts.</p> <p>'Good,' he said. He turned towards his machine.</p> <p>'Just a moment,' said the diamond smuggler. There was a sullen note in his voice.</p> <p>The pilot turned back and faced him. He thought: it's the voice of a servant who has screwed himself up to complain about his food. 'Ja. What is it?'</p> <p>'Things are getting too hot. At the mines. I don't like it at all. There's been a big intelligence man down from London. You've read about him. This man Sillitoe. They say he's been hired by the Diamond Corporation. There've been a lot of new regulations and all punishments have been doubled. It's frightened out some of my smaller men. I had to be ruthless and, well, one of them somehow fell into the crusher. That tightened things up a bit. But I've had to pay more. An extra ten per cent. And they're still not satisfied. One of these days those security people are going to get one of my middlemen. And you know these black swine. They can't stand a real beating.' He looked swiftly into the pilot's eyes and then away again. 'For the matter of that I doubt if anyone could stand the sjambok. Not even me.'</p> <p>'So?' said the pilot. He paused. 'Do you want me to pass this threat back to ABC?'</p> <p>'I'm not threatening anyone,' said the other man hastily.' I just want them to know that it's getting tough. They must know it themselves. They must know about this man Sillitoe. And look what the Chairman said in our annual report. He said that our mines were losing more than two million pounds a year through smug-gling and IDE and that it was up to the government to stop it. And what does that mean? It means "stop me"!'</p> <p>'And me,' said the pilot mildly. 'So what do you want? More money?'</p> <p>'Yes,' said the other man stubbornly. 'I want a bigger cut. Twenty per cent more or I'll have to quit.'

Long revered for its encyclopedic entries on everything from cooking techniques, ingredients, and recipes to equipment, food histories, and culinary biographies, it is the one book every professional chef and avid home cook must have on his or her kitchen shelf. In fact, Julia Child once wrote, "If I were allowed only one reference book in my library, <i>Larousse Gastronomique </i>would be it, without question."<br><br>The culinary landscape has changed dramatically in the last decade, prompting a complete revision of this classic work. <i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> has now been updated to add the latest advancements that have forever changed the way we cook, including modern technological methods, such as sous-vide cooking and molecular gastronomy. All-new color ingredient-identification photographs give this edition a fresh, elegant look. And for the first time, <i>Larousse</i> features more than 400 reportage photos&#x2013;candid images of upscale restaurants from around the world&#x2013;that give behind-the-scenes access into the kitchens where the finest food is created. Dozens of new biographies of people who have made significant contributions to the food world debut in this revision, including such luminaries as Ferran Adri�, Daniel Boulud, Alice Waters, Gaston Len�tre, Thomas Keller, James Beard, and Julia Child.<br><br>With entries arranged in encyclopedic fashion, <i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> is not only incredibly user-friendly, but it is also a fantastic read for anyone who loves food. Skip from Roasting to Robert (a classic French sauce), and then to Robiola (the Italian cheese); or go from Sake to Salad&#x2013;with dozens of recipes&#x2013;and on to Salamander, a type of oven used in professional kitchens for caramelizing (and named after the legendary fire-resistant animal). An index at the end of the book of all 3,800 recipes for cuisines from around the world makes it easy to find a myriad of preparations for any ingredient (eggs or chicken, for example) or type of dish (such as cakes or sauces).<br><br>The unparalleled depth and breadth of information&#x2013;from the traditional to the cutting-edge&#x2013;make this newest edition of <i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> indispensable for every cook.</p><p>Librairie Larousse&#x2019;s Gastronomic Committee includes scores of writers, researchers, editors, photographers, illustrators, and translators who make <i>Larousse Gastronomique</i> the world&#x2019;s most authoritative culinary reference book.

Best-selling author Edward T. Welch shares the comfort and peace of Jesus in fifty brief readings for those who wrestle with fear.</p> <p><em>A Small Book for the Anxious Heart&nbsp;</em>is a small but powerful devotional to remind men and women of the encouraging, beautiful words in Scripture to anxious people.</p> <p>While many books on fear and anxiety exist&#x2014;promising to help men and women manage their struggles with methods and formulas&#x2014;this devotional reaches deeper into Scripture, making the Word of God more accessible. Don&#x2019;t put a Band-Aid on your fear and anxiety; rather, learn to bring your fear to Jesus, relying on his Word.</p> <p>Welch has been counseling for over thirty-eight years and is the author of more than a dozen books, including&nbsp;<em>A Small Book about a Big&nbsp;Problem</em>,&nbsp;<em>Running&nbsp;Scared: Fear, Worry and the God of Rest</em>,&nbsp;<em>Shame Interrupted</em>,&nbsp;<em>When People Are Big and God Is Small</em>, and many others.</p> <p>Jesus cares for us, and in these readings, Welch invites readers to trust him for today, knowing he goes before us always.</p></p><p><p> Edward T. Welch, MDiv, PhD, is a licensed psychologist and faculty member at the Christian Counseling &amp; Educational Foundation (CCEF). He earned a PhD in counseling (neuropsychology) from the University of Utah and has a Master of Divinity degree from Biblical Theological Seminary. Ed has been counseling for over thirty years and has written extensively on the topics of depression, fear, and addictions. His biblical counseling books include </p> <em> Shame Interrupted; When People Are Big and God Is Small; Addictions: A Banquet in the Grave; Depression: Looking Up from the Stubborn Darkness; Crossroads: A Step-by-Step Guide Away from Addiction; Running Scared: Fear, Worry, and the God of Rest; When I Am Afraid: A Step-by-Step Guide Away from Fear and Anxiety; Side by Side: Walking with Others in Wisdom and Love; </em> <p> and </p> <em> A Small Book about a Big Problem: Meditations on Anger, Patience, and Peace. </em><p>For those of us who often find ourselves simmering in anxious thoughts, we need something more than being told not to worry. We need something else, something better, to fill and shape our thoughts and feelings. Each short entry in this little book provides a dose of Scriptural truth to keep nudging us toward peace and rest in Christ.&#x201d;<br><strong>Nancy Guthrie,</strong> Author and Bible teacher</p> <p>&#x201c;Packed into <em>A Small Book for the Anxious Heart</em> is deep wisdom to help us with a persistent misery&#x2014;the anxiety that robs us of freedom. And here is why I respect the counsel Ed Welch offers. It isn&#x2019;t about handy tips for our own crisis management, but the moment-by-moment nearness of the Lord himself.&#x201d;<br><strong>Ray Ortlund,</strong> Pastor, Immanuel Church, Nashville</p> <p>&#x201c;Anxiety is a deep struggle that is rarely removed in one fell swoop. Instead, it requires a steady flow of Scripture to quell its tendency to consume our lives. <em>A Small Book for the Anxious Heart</em> provides readers with a sustaining stream of hope from the Bible.&#x201d;<br><strong>Curtis Solomon,</strong> Executive Director, Biblical Counseling Coalition</p> <p>&#x201c;When anxious, we need gallons of biblical wisdom for our muddled thoughts. But we are exhausted and can muster little emotional energy for books deep enough to help. Ed offers page-and-a-half chapters, thimblefuls of truth we can manage that soothe and steady.&#x201d;<br><strong>Steve Estes,</strong> Pastor, Brick Lane Community Church; coauthor of <em>When God Weep</em></p> <p>&#x201c;Anxiety, hassle, worry, stress, and bouts of panic are all rogues that harass us as we roam this broken world. Ed Welch gets the problem and knows we need fresh faith for each day&#x2019;s burdens. <em>A Small Book for the Anxious Heart</em> is offered as an essential weapon in the fight for faith, peace, and joy.&#x201d;<br><strong>Dave Harvey,</strong> Pastor; blogger; teacher; author of <em>I Still Do! Growing Closer and Stronger through Life&#x2019;s Defining Moments</em></p> <p>&#x201c;In fifty days of meditations, Dr. Welch pens short, pointed, and crystalline reflections that take hearts captive to fear and frees them to faith in Christ.&#x201d;<br><strong>Alfred Poirier,</strong> Visiting professor at Westminster Theological Seminary; author of <em>The Peacemaking Pastor</em></p> <p>&#x201c;With clear, intimate writing, this small book addresses burdens carried by so many of us. On each page, truth and love are blended so that real life is the arena and the real God is the center. If we anxious ones will open its pages, we will again find God drawing wondrously near to us.&#x201d;<br><strong>Andrew Nicholls,</strong> Director of Pastoral Care, Oak Hill College, London; coauthor of <em>Real Change: Becoming More Like Jesus in Everyday Life</em></p> <p>&#x201c;If you struggle with worry and fear, digest these bite-size chunks each day for fifty days, and I promise that your love for Christ will grow. Ed Welch&#x2019;s <em>A Small Book for the Anxious Heart</em> is a goldmine of biblical truths for the worried soul.&#x201d;<br><strong>Deepak Reju,</strong> Pastor of Biblical Counseling and Family Ministry, Capitol Hill Baptist Church, Washington, DC; author of <em>On Guard</em> and <em>She&#x2019;s Got the Wrong Guy</em></p> <p>&#x201c;Popular anxiety treatments are generally designed for the isolated individual. Ed refuses to concede isolation as the given, and helps us find God and others nearby when we are afraid. So we get to join him in finding today&#x2019;s manna, living in today rather than tomorrow, and finding refuge from all that is so understandably scary.&#x201d;<br><strong>Michael Gembola,</strong> Executive Director, Blue Ridge Christian Counseling</p> <p>&#x201c;This is exactly what my anxious heart needed: briefly explained, surgically precise, and accurately applied Scripture to the very site of each metastasis and malignant cause of anxiety, fear, and worry within me. Repentance and renewed faith flourished within me as I savored every line of this welcome tool of grace.&#x201d;<br><strong>Joseph Vincent Novenson,</strong> Pastor, Lookout Mountain Presbyterian Church, TN</p></p><h2>How To Annihilate A Narcissist: In The Family Court</h2><p><p>Are you considering raising, or defending yourself against, legal action in the family court with a narcissistic opponent?</p><p>Is your opponent controlling, abusive, unreasonable, manipulative, vindictive and obstructive?</p><p>&nbsp;Can they convincingly hide these behavioural traits from the judge and other professionals involved?</p><p>Does the narcissist project this behaviour onto you, and make shocking, false allegations?</p><p>Do they attempt to embarrass you and defame your character?</p><p>How To Annihilate A Narcissist In The Family Court will give you the knowledge required, to set you on the path for a successful outcome.

George Harrison married Olivia Arias in 1978 and together they have a son, Dhani.A 400-page memoir from the Quiet Beatle? Can it be? Well, yes and no: only about 60 pages of this earnest tome, originally published in 1980, are devoted to Harrison's recollections of life before, during and (notably) after the Beatles. His memories, which manage to feel fresh and distant at the same time, come to readers via transcripts of his conversations with Derek Taylor (1932-1997), the Beatles press officer and ghostwriter of Brian Epstein's memoir. Harrison (1943-2001) was only in his late 30s when I Me Mine came out-the Beatles had formed, changed music forever and disbanded before his 28th birthday. The rest of this volume consists of photos with whimsical captions ("the author enjoying a cheese sandwich with some friends" is assigned to a picture of Harrison with a sitar) and facsimiles of his handwritten lyrics (including a fairly different version of "Taxman"), each accompanied by a brief explanation (ideas expressed in "It's All Too Much," for example, were inspired by LSD and "confirmed in meditation"). Most of the songs were composed after Harrison's immersion in Hinduism; divorced from their melodies, lyrics espousing love, peace and harmony tend to take on a certain sameness. This volume offers much to Beatles zealots, but for the casual fan, Harrison will likely remain as admirable and as inscrutable as ever.

Birsh, Ed.D., </b>Certified Academic Language Therapist (CALT), Qualified Instructor (QI). Dr. Birsh's enduring belief that well-prepared, informed teachers are the major influence on effective instruction in the field of reading and dyslexia had its beginning in 1960, when she met her first student who, although 18 years old, read poorly. The quest to find answers to this puzzle led her to a master's degree in remedial reading and a doctorate in reading and language at Teachers College, Columbia University. After training with Aylett R. Cox in Dallas, Texas, she became a Certified Academic Language Therapist and Qualified Instructor, founding and directing the Multisensory Teaching of Basic Language Skills courses at Teachers College in the Department of Curriculum and Teaching, Program in Learning Disabilities. Since her retirement in 2000, Dr. Birsh has maintained her commitment to teacher preparation by editing the first three editions of Multisensory Teaching of Basic Language Skills, and co-editing the fourth edition with Suzanne Carreker, Ph.D. Dr. Birsh has given professional development workshops, consulted with private and public schools, written articles, and worked with students with dyslexia.

Everyone said she would never walk again. But Wilma refused to believe it. Not only would she walk again, she vowed, she&#39;d run. And she did run--all the way to the Olympics, where she became the first American woman to earn three gold medals in a single olympiad. This dramatic and inspiring true story is illustrated in bold watercolor and acrylic paintings by Caldecott Medal-winning artist David Diaz.</p><p><b>Kathleen Krull</b>&nbsp;is well known for her innovative, award-winning nonfiction for young people, including <i>Lives of the Explorers, Lives of the Musicians,</i> and all other books in this popular series illustrated by Kathryn Hewitt. She is also the author of <i>Harvesting Hope: The Story of Cesar Chavez,</i> illustrated by Yuyi Morales, as well as <i>The Beatles Were Fab (and They Were Funny)</i> and <i>Lincoln Tells a Joke: How Laughter Saved the President (and the Country),</i> both co-written with Paul Brewer and illustrated by Stacy Innerst. She lives in San Diego, California. Visit her online at kathleenkrull.com.&nbsp;<br><br>David Diaz has illustrated numerous award-winning books for children, including <i>Smoky Night</i> by Eve Bunting, for which he was awarded the Caldecott Medal; <i>The Wanderer</i> by Sharon Creech, which received a Newbery Honor; and <i>Diego: Bigger Than Life</i> by Carmen T. Bernier-Grand, a Pura Belpr�&nbsp;Honor Award winner. An illustrator and graphic designer for more than twenty-five years, he is also a painter and an accomplished ceramic artist. Mr. Diaz lives in Carlsbad, California."No one expected such a tiny girl to have a first birthday," begins this inspiring biographical sketch of a legendary track stars. Born in 1940 in Tennessee, the chronically sickly though "lively" Rudolph contracted polio just before her fifth birthday. Though not expected to walk again, the fiercely determined girl persevered with her leg exercises; by the time she was 12, she no longer needed her steel brace. Eight years later, Rudolph represented the U.S. in the 1960 Olympics in Rome, where, despite a twisted ankle, she became the first American woman to win three gold medals during a single Olympic competition. Krull's (Lives of the Musicians) characteristic, conversational style serves her especially well here. Through her words the nearly superhuman Rudolph seems both personable and recognizable. Rendered in acrylic, watercolor and gouache, Caldecott Medalist Diaz's (Smoky Night) imposing, richly hued illustrations have a distinctive, cubist feel. The artist's bold design superimposes this art against sepia-toned photographs of relevant background images: playground sand, wooden fence slats, the gravel of a running track. This juxtaposition yields busy, effectively textured pages, flawed only by the text's curiously embellished font-the letters look as though they have been speckled with either ink blots or dust. A triumphant story, triumphantly relayed.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Mr. Hall, himself an honorary 33x Mason, reveals the profounder aspects of this ancient Fraternity which has been a source of inspiration to so many individuals through the centuries. The basic symbolism of the three degrees of the Blue Lodge is explained. The text can be read with profit by both new and old Masons, for within its pages lies an interpretation of Masonic symbolism which supplements the monitorial instruction usually given in the lodges. The leading Masonic scholars of all times have agreed that the symbols of the Fraternity are susceptible of the most profound interpretation and thus reveal to the truly initiated certain secrets concerning the spiritual realities of life. Freemasonry is therefore more than a mere social organization a few centuries old, and can be regarded as a perpetuation of the philosophical mysteries and initiations of the ancients. This is in keeping with the inner tradition of the Craft, a heritage from pre-Revival days. The present volume will appeal to the thoughtful Mason as an inspiring work, for it satisfies the yearning for further light and leads the initiate to that Sanctum Sanctorum where the mysteries are revealed. The book is a contribution to Masonic idealism, revealing the profounder aspects of our ancient and gentle Fraternity - those unique and distinctive features which have proved a constant inspiration through the centuries.

This self-assured child would grow up to become the CEO of Beatrice International and one of the most successful entrepreneurs ever. At the time of his death in 1993, his personal fortune was estimated in excess of $400 million and his vast commercial empire spanned four continents. Despite the notoriety surrounding Lewis's financial coups, little has been written about the life of this remarkable man. Based on Lewis's unfinished autobiography, as well as scores of interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, the book cuts through the myth and media hype to reveal the man behind the legend. What emerges is a vivid portrait of a proud, fiercely determined individual with a razor-sharp tongue &#x2014; and an intellect to match &#x2014; who would settle for nothing less than excellence from himself and others.</p><p>"Why should white guys have all the fun?" One of Reginald Lewis&#x2019;s earliest childhood memories was of hearing his grandparents talk of employment discrimination against African-Americans. When asked for his opinion on the subject, six-year-old Reg simply replied: "Why should white guys have all the fun?" Why, indeed! This precociously self-assured boy would grow up to become the wealthiest black man in history and one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time. Profiled in Forbes magazine as one of the four-hundred wealthiest businesspeople in America, Lewis reigned over a commercial empire spanning four continents. At the time of his death in 1993, his personal fortune was estimated by Forbes to be in excess of $400 million. Having apprenticed in the art of the leveraged buyout while head of his own successful Wall Street law firm, he went on to mastermind some of the most spectacular deals ever, including the $1 billion purchase of food giant Beatrice International&#x2014;one of the largest leveraged buyouts ever. A noted art collector and connoisseur, he was also a celebrated philanthropist who gave away a vast fortune to charity. Yet despite the notoriety surrounding Lewis&#x2019;s financial coups, until now, little has been written about the life of this remarkable but private man. Based on Reginald Lewis&#x2019;s unfinished autobiography as well as scores of interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, "Why Should White Guys Have All the Fun?" cuts through the myth and media hype to reveal the man behind the legend. What emerges is a vivid portrait of a proud, fiercely determined individual with a razor-sharp tongue&#x2014;and an intellect to match&#x2014;who would settle for nothing less than excellence from himself and others. Tracing Lewis&#x2019;s rise from an east Baltimore working-class neighborhood to Harvard Law School and ultimately into the elite circle of Wall Street deal-makers, journalist Blair Walker shows how Lewis&#x2019;s lifelong hunger for wealth and personal achievement drove him to success at whatever he turned his hand to. Walker also provides us with a rare insider&#x2019;s view of Lewis, the iron-willed negotiator and brilliant business strategist in action as he finesses one phenomenal deal after another. An inspiring tale of a remarkable man&#x2019;s victory against overwhelming odds, "Why Should White Guys Have All the Fun?" is a book as memorable as the man whose story it tells."Voyages deep into the frenzied, complex world of LBO transactions."&#x2014;BusinessWeek. <p>"Sheds light on an important chapter in both African-American and American business history."&#x2014;Earl G.

With this book, you&#x2019;ll experience the excitement of finding, collecting, and identifying rocks and minerals. Dan R. Lynch, author of many field guides, presents a children&#x2019;s introduction to our amazing Earth. The book begins with geology basics, such as where rocks come from and how Earth&#x2019;s surface changes over time. Next, young readers are provided with an identification guide, which features full-color photographs and ID tips on 75 types of common and collectible rocks and minerals. From there, a &#x201c;how to&#x201d; section includes details on what to look for, where to look, and what to bring, as well as safety considerations. With rock collecting guidelines that the whole family will learn from and enjoy, this fun guide is engaging and informative&#x2015;with plenty of kid-appeal&#x2015;as it starts children on the path toward becoming successful rock collectors!</p></p><p><b>Dan R. Lynch</b> has a degree in graphic design with emphasis on photography from the University of Minnesota Duluth. But before his love of art and writing came a passion for rocks and minerals, developed during his lifetime growing up in his parents&#x2019; rock shop in Two Harbors, Minnesota. Combining the two aspects of his life seemed a natural choice, and he enjoys researching, writing about, and taking photographs of rocks and minerals. Working with his father, Bob Lynch, a respected veteran of Lake Superior&#x2019;s agate-collecting community, Dan spearheads their series of rock and mineral field guides&#x2015;definitive guidebooks that help amateurs &#x201c;decode&#x201d; the complexities of geology and mineralogy. He also takes special care to ensure that his photographs complement the text and always represent each rock or mineral exactly as it appears in person. He currently lives in Madison, Wisconsin, with his wife, Julie, where he works as a writer and photographer.<p><b>ALL ABOUT GEOLOGY</b></p> <p>If you want to collect rocks, it helps to know a little about geology. Geology is the study of the Earth and what it&#x2019;s made of. Geology also explores the Earth&#x2019;s history and how it has changed since it formed long ago.</p> <p>A scientist who works in geology is called a geologist. A geologist studies rocks and minerals and everything else about the Earth beneath our feet.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rocks and minerals are very important to understand because they make up the Earth and because we use them every day. We use rocks to build houses and walls, and we use minerals to make many things, like coins, computers, and glass. But we can also use rocks and minerals to learn amazing things, like the age of the Earth and what kinds of animals lived long ago.</p> <p>Rocks and minerals are also fun to collect! By picking up rocks and writing down where you found them, you can learn a lot about geology. And you can build your collection every time you visit a new place. But you're not allowed to collect just anywhere! Check out page 126 to make sure it's OK to collect where you are. And when in doubt, ask first!</p> <p><b>Our Earth</b></p> <p>The Earth is always changing. The mountains, oceans, and rocks seem like they will be here forever. But they will be gone someday, and something new will be in their place. These changes happen because of the Earth&#x2019;s geology.</p> <p>The Earth is made up of layers. The outside of the Earth, where all the plants, animals, and people live, is called the crust. The crust is like a thin, hard shell of rock on the surface of the planet. It has all the mountains, plains, oceans, and deserts that we see, but the crust is affected by the layers beneath it.</p> <p>Deeper inside the Earth, there is another layer called the mantle. It is very hot and made up of melted rock. It&#x2019;s so far down that we can&#x2019;t dig there. The melted rock in the mantle is called magma. The mantle&#x2019;s heat is like a big oven, and all of that heat causes the crust above it to move around. Sometimes the magma pushes its way up through the crust&#x2015;we call that a volcano!&nbsp;</p> <p>Deeper down, there are even hotter layers, and some of those layers are melted and others are solid. At the very center of the Earth is a hot, solid core made of metal.&nbsp;</p> <p>When we study geology, we look at what the Earth is made of and how the inside of the Earth moves and changes. Geology also involves how the weather can change the Earth&#x2019;s surface long-term. Over a long time, wind, rain, and ice can wear down rocks, and even whole mountains can be worn away!&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Inside the Earth</b></p> <p><b>The Crust</b>: The ground, mountains, and the ocean are all part of the thin outer crust.</p> <p><b>Upper Mantle</b>: Located just underneath the crust, the upper mantle is hot and soft because it is made up of melted rock.</p> <p><b>Lower Mantle&nbsp;</b>: The lower mantle is made of rocks that won&#x2019;t melt because they&#x2019;re buried too deep, even though it is very hot.</p> <p><b>Outer and Inner Core</b>: The outer core is so hot that everything there melts and swirls around the inner core, which is made up of solid metal!</p></p><h2>Rhett &amp; Link's Book of Mythicality: A Field Guide to Curiosity, Creativity, and Tomfoolery</h2><p><b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER<br><br>From the YouTube superstars and creators of&nbsp;<i>Good Mythical Morning</i>&nbsp;comes the ultimate guide to living a &#x201c;Mythical&#x201d; life, featuring stories and photos from their lifelong friendship, as well as awesomely illustrated guides, charts, and activities aimed at laughing more, learning more, and never taking yourself too seriously.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Thanks for reading this description.

This mentality has been known to spread easily to friends and loved ones.</p><p><b>Rhett &amp; Link</b>, best friends since the first grade, are an LA-based comedic duo known for hosting the most-watched daily talk show on the Internet,&nbsp;<i>Good Mythical Morning,</i> their narrative series <i>Rhett &amp; Link's Buddy System,</i> the award-winning weekly podcast <i>Ear Biscuits,</i> as well as their&nbsp;wildly popular comedic songs, sketches,&nbsp;and viral low-budget local commercials.&nbsp;Rhett &amp; Link&#x2019;s YouTube channels have a combined subscriber base of over 19 million people with over 4 billion total views. They have been featured on and in <i>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, The Conan O&#x2019;Brien Show, Variety, USA Today,</i> and <i>Mashable.</i><i>A Mythical Welcome</i><br> &nbsp;<br> YOU DID IT! You have officially made at least one good decision today. By opening this book you are opening yourself up to the very real possibility of increased Mythicality in your life. Why, exactly, you decided to open this book is not important. Maybe you heard that this book contains a skyscraper-shaped board game that builds character (true), a visual guide to slow dancing poses (true), apocalyptic-themed party ideas (true), and actual sheet music and lyrics for the song we want you to sing&#x2014;and hopefully play on the organ&#x2014;at our funeral (also true). Or maybe you opened this book because you wanted to see pictures from the time Link broke his pelvis (hilarious unless you were Link), or read about the time Rhett was confronted by a tattooed man while wearing a child&#x2019;s shirt (it didn&#x2019;t turn out well). Or perhaps you heard that one chapter of this book was written by our wives (a very risky decision) and another entire chapter was written from the future (the United States Department of Time Travel and Extraterrestrial Affairs will not permit us to confirm nor deny the validity of said chapter from the future). Regardless of your reasons, all that matters now is that, by opening this book, you have just merged onto the highway to Mythicality. It would probably be helpful to tell you what Mythicality is (if you don&#x2019;t happen to know already). Here&#x2019;s a technical-sounding definition:<br> &nbsp;<br> Myth�i�cal�i�ty (mi-thi-&#x2c8;ka-l&#x259;-t&#x113;) noun<br> 1. the quality or state of being that embodies a synergistic coalescence of curiosity, creativity, and tomfoolery (sometimes referred to as curiotomfoolivity), ideally experienced in the context of friendship and intended to bring goodwill to the universe. Origin: 2009; RhettandLinkish.<br> &nbsp;<br> You may think you can&#x2019;t go around adding &#x201c;-ity&#x201d; to any word you want and then giving it your own meaning. But in the age of the Internet, you can&#x2014;especially when there isn&#x2019;t already a definition that communicates exactly what you&#x2019;re trying to say. Mythicality is the word we&#x2019;ve come up with that captures what&#x2019;s been at the heart of our friendship from the very beginning. We&#x2019;ll unpack it in layman&#x2019;s terms in a moment, but first, some background might be helpful.<br> &nbsp;<br> We met in 1984 on the first day of first grade at Buies Creek Elementary School in Buies Creek, North Carolina, when our teacher, Ms. Locklear, held us both in from recess for writing profanity on our desks (&#x201c;hell&#x201d; and &#x201c;dam&#x201d; if you&#x2019;re wondering&#x2014;spelling wasn&#x2019;t Link&#x2019;s strongest subject). She then sentenced us to coloring pictures of mythical beasts. We&#x2019;ve been best friends ever since. Over twenty years later, when YouTube was invented, we began uploading videos of questionable quality like &#x201c;Cutting Strangers&#x2019; Nosehairs at the Mall&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Unibrow Song.&#x201d; These videos are still online, although we strongly advise against watching them if you have an active cringe reflex. Surprisingly&#x2014;and thankfully&#x2014;enough people responded positively to these videos to encourage us to make more. <br> &nbsp;<br> In 2009, we began to get a sense that there should be a name for this group of individuals who had collectively determined that we were more funny than obnoxious. So, we took the easy way out and asked them to name themselves. After members of the RhettandLinKommunity (an online fan site) threw around a number of suggestions including &#x201c;Unicornholers&#x201d; and &#x201c;Rinkles,&#x201d; we all eventually settled on &#x201c;Mythical Beasts.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Since then, we&#x2019;ve gotten a little carried away with incorporating the term &#x201c;Mythical&#x201d; into our lives. In 2012, when we decided to launch a daily morning talk show, we naturally named it Good Mythical Morning. We founded Mythical Entertainment; created the Mythical Mail Boulder, the Mythical Mail Museum, and the Wheel of Mythicality; and sold a Mythical Shoe, a Good Mythical Mug, and a Mythical Pomade. It&#x2019;s gotten a bit out of hand, we know.<br> &nbsp;<br> Of course, this terminology has been a little confusing for those other than the Mythical Beasts. When we tell strangers that we have a show called Good Mythical Morning, we can sense their suspicion that the show only exists in our imaginations and that we are actually unemployed. But for us, Mythicality encompasses all of the qualities that we want our work, our friendship, and our lives to display. It&#x2019;s characterized by a desire to learn and do new things, an appreciation of originality, and a tendency to not take yourself too seriously. A person who is willing to risk pursuing these values&#x2014;for the purpose of making the world a better place&#x2014;is a true Mythical Beast.<br> &nbsp;<br> We firmly believe that you can approach any aspect of your life with Mythicality, from the way you comb your hair to the way you say &#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; and that&#x2019;s what we hope to demonstrate in this book. For us, it turns out that many of the experiences throughout our lifelong friendship, including hitchhiking, eating leeches and spiders, floating in a sensory deprivation tank, and even throwing balls at each other&#x2019;s balls have all helped to shape our understanding of what Mythicality is all about.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to our stories, this book contains a collection of guides, charts, and activities to help you navigate a host of life situations with Mythicality, like a laughter compatibility test to take with a friend, a decision tree to consult if you get flipped off by a stranger, and step-by-step instructions on how to eat nasty foods (just to name a few). There are also Mythical merit badges at the opening of each chapter so you can track your progress (this is largely because we have a personal merit badge void that we&#x2019;ve been trying to fill ever since we both dropped out of Cub Scouts after only one meeting). Of course, you can just read this book and not actually do anything we suggest. We have no way of knowing, unless you have one of the five copies of this book that has a small, imperceptible microphone and camera on the cover.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because there are two of us, we will often write in the collective voice, just like we are doing right now. If it&#x2019;s helpful for you to imagine us using some sort of &#x201c;talking harmony,&#x201d; feel free to do so. Also, since we are actually two distinct people, we will be speaking individually throughout the book. In those cases,<br> it will look like this:<br> &nbsp;<br> RHETT: Hi, this is Rhett. When I&#x2019;m saying something, you&#x2019;ll see this. I&#x2019;m not 100 percent sure what it looks like, because I wrote this before we decided how to make it look when I&#x2019;m talking. But I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s really cool.<br> &nbsp;<br> LINK: I&#x2019;m Link, and this is what it will look like when I&#x2019;m talking. It looks a little cooler than it does when Rhett is talking, don&#x2019;t you think? That&#x2019;s how you can remember that it&#x2019;s me talking: when it looks a little cooler. Also, I will be talking in a slightly cooler voice, so you can imagine that while reading my parts.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you&#x2019;re new to our Mythical world, welcome! (And don&#x2019;t be scared.) If you already consider yourself a member of the Mythical herd, thank you. One of the most Mythical parts of our lives is being able to share our work with Beasts worldwide. Without you, we would have never been given the opportunity to write this book. By choosing to read it, you&#x2019;re demonstrating that you want to be your Mythical best. If you stole the book, you can probably still return it&#x2014;assuming you have not already drooled excessively on it or otherwise defaced it. If you can&#x2019;t work up the courage to return it, at least finish reading it. Then, give it to someone you care about.

Wren, Owl, and Raven take to the skies while Badger, Mole, and Mouse search on the ground.

Visit Jane at ChapmanandWarnes.com.PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2014;This likable character and his animal friends are back in one of their best outings since <i>Bear Snores On</i> (S &amp; S, 2002). While walking in the woods, Bear gets lost, and the other critters begin to worry about him. They form a search party, find their friend, and return to the lair to cuddle up and fall asleep, and finally, "the bear feels safe." Wilson's rhyming text moves along at a steady clip, with only the smallest missteps in meter, and the repeated refrain begs for audience participation. Chapman's acrylic illustrations perfectly mesh realism with emotional expression; the characters show their concern for Bear, whose fear is almost palpable. The combination of full-bleed spreads, single-page paintings, and smaller insets keeps the story flowing and encourages page turns. Bear's cozy den, painted in warm oranges and browns, contrasts effectively with the outdoor scenes, done in blacks, blues, and grays. The reassuring story is simple, but speaks to children's fears and the safety they find with the people who care about them, creating a comforting and accessible forum for discussion. With its large, richly colored illustrations, this book will work equally well one-on-one or in storytime, and listeners are sure to request repeated readings.&#x2014;<i>Amy Lilien-Harper, The Ferguson Library, Stamford, CT</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fifteen-year-old Ivy lives with her family as tenants on a small tobacco farm, but when her parents die, Ivy is left to care for her grandmother, older sister, and nephew. As she struggles with her grandmother's aging, her sister's mental illness, and her own epilepsy, she realizes they might need more than she can give.<br>When Jane Forrester takes a position as Grace County's newest social worker, she is given the task of recommending which of her clients should be sterilized without their knowledge or consent. The state's rationalization is that if her clients are poor, or ill, or deemed in some way "unfit" they should not be allowed to have children. But soon Jane becomes emotionally invested in her clients' lives, causing tension with her new husband and her supervisors. No one understands why Jane would want to become a caseworker for the Department of Public Health when she could be a housewife and Junior League member. As Jane is drawn in by the Hart women, she begins to discover the secrets of the small farm&#x2015;secrets much darker than she would have guessed. Soon, she must decide whether to take drastic action to help them, or risk losing a life-changing battle.<br><i></i><br><i>Necessary Lies</i> is the story of these two young women, seemingly worlds apart, but both haunted by tragedy.

She lives in North Carolina with her partner, photographer John Pagliuca, and her shelties, Keeper and Cole.</p>JUNE 22, 2011 <br>1 <br> <i>Brenna</i> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>It was an odd request&#x2014;visit a stranger&#x2019;s house and peer inside a closet&#x2014;and as I drove through the neighborhood searching for the address, I felt my anxiety mounting. <br>There it was: number 247. I hadn&#x2019;t expected the house to be so large. It stood apart from its neighbors on the gently winding road, flanked on either side by huge magnolia trees, tall oaks, and crape myrtle. It was painted a soft buttery yellow with white trim, and everything about it looked crisp and clean in the early morning sun. Every house I&#x2019;d passed, although different in architecture, had the same stately yet inviting look. I didn&#x2019;t know Raleigh well at all, but this had to be one of the most beautiful old neighborhoods in the city. <br>I parked close to the curb and headed up the walk. Potted plants lined either side of the broad steps that led up to the wraparound porch. I glanced at my watch. I had an hour before I needed to be back at the hotel. No rush, though my nerves were really acting up. There was so much I hoped would go well today, and so much of it was out of my control. <br>I rang the bell and heard it chime inside the house. I could see someone pass behind the sidelight and then the door opened. The woman&#x2014;forty, maybe? At least ten years younger than me&#x2014;smiled, although that didn&#x2019;t mask her harried expression. I felt bad for bothering her this early. She wore white shorts, a pink striped T-shirt, and tennis shoes, and sported a glowing tan. She was the petite, toned, and well-put-together sort of woman that always made me feel sloppy, even though I knew I looked fine in my black pants and blue blouse. <br>&#x201c;Brenna?&#x201d; She ran her fingers through her short-short, spiky blond hair. <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And you must be Jennifer.&#x201d; <br>Jennifer peered behind me. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not with you?&#x201d; she asked. <br>I shook my head. &#x201c;I thought she&#x2019;d come, but at the last minute she said she just couldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>Jennifer nodded. &#x201c;Today must be really hard for her.&#x201d; She took a step back from the doorway. &#x201c;Come on in,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;My kids are done with school for the summer, but they have swim-team practice this morning, so we&#x2019;re in luck. We have the house to ourselves. The kids are always too full of questions.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; I walked past her into the foyer. I was glad no one else was home. I wished I had the house totally to myself, to be honest. I would have loved to explore it. But that wasn&#x2019;t why I was here. <br>&#x201c;Can I get you anything?&#x201d; Jennifer asked. &#x201c;Coffee?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m good, thanks.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, come on then. I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d; <br>She led me to the broad, winding staircase and we climbed it without speaking, my shoes on the shiny dark hardwood treads making the only sound. <br>&#x201c;How long have you been in the house?&#x201d; I asked when we reached the second story. <br>&#x201c;Five years,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We redid everything. I mean, we painted every single room and every inch of molding. And every closet, too, except for that one.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you paint that one?&#x201d; I asked as I followed her down a short hallway. <br>&#x201c;The woman we bought the house from specifically told us not to. She said that the couple <i>she&#x2019;d</i> bought the house from had also told her not to, but nobody seemed to understand why not. The woman we bought it from showed us the writing. My husband thought we should just paint over it&#x2014;I think he was spooked by it&#x2014;but I talked him out of it. It&#x2019;s a <i>closet.</i> What would it hurt to leave it unpainted?&#x201d; We&#x2019;d reached the closed door at the end of the hall. &#x201c;I had no idea what it meant until I spoke to you on the phone.&#x201d; She pushed open the door. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my daughter&#x2019;s room now,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;so excuse the mess.&#x201d; <br>It wasn&#x2019;t what I&#x2019;d call messy at all. My twin daughters&#x2019; rooms had been far worse. &#x201c;How old&#x2019;s your daughter?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;Ten. Thus the Justin Bieber obsession.&#x201d; She swept her arm through the air to take in the lavender room and its nearly wall-to-wall posters. <br>&#x201c;It only gets worse.&#x201d; I smiled. &#x201c;I barely survived my girls&#x2019; teen years.&#x201d; I thought of my family&#x2014;my husband and my daughters and their babies&#x2014;up in Maryland and suddenly missed them. I hoped I&#x2019;d be home by the weekend, when all of this would be over. <br>Jennifer opened the closet door. It was a small closet, the type you&#x2019;d find in these older homes, and it was crammed with clothes on hangers and shoes helter-skelter on the floor. I felt a chill, as though a ghost had slipped past me into the room. I hugged my arms as Jennifer pulled a cord to turn on the light. She pressed the clothes to one side of the closet. <br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; she said, pointing to the left wall at about the level of my knees. &#x201c;Maybe we need a flashlight?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Or I can just take a bunch of these clothes out. I should have done that before you got here.&#x201d; She lifted an armload of the clothes and struggled to disengage the hangers before carrying them from the closet. Without the clothing, the closet filled with light and I squatted inside the tight space, pushing pink sneakers and a pair of sandals out of my way. <br>I ran my fingers over the words carved into the wall. Ancient paint snagged my fingertips where it had chipped away around the letters. <i>&#x201c;Ivy and Mary was here.&#x201d;</i> All at once, I felt overwhelmed by the fear they must have felt back then, and by their courage. When I stood up, I was brushing tears from my eyes. <br>Jennifer touched my arm. &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m grateful to you for not covering that over. It makes it real to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If we ever move out of this house, we&#x2019;ll tell the new owners to leave it alone, too. It&#x2019;s a little bit of history, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; <br>I nodded. I remembered my phone in my purse. &#x201c;May I take a picture of it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course!&#x201d; Jennifer said, then added with a laugh, &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t get my daughter&#x2019;s messy closet in it.&#x201d; <br>I pulled out my phone and knelt down near the writing on the wall. I snapped the picture and felt the presence of a ghost again, but this time it wrapped around me like an embrace. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Diane Chamberlain Books, Inc. <br></p><h2>El ratoncito de la moto (The Mouse and the Motorcycle, Spanish Edition)</h2><p><p><em>This high-quality Spanish-language book can be enjoyed by fluent Spanish speakers as well as those learning the language, whether at home or in a classroom.</em></p><p><strong>Ralph no es un rat�n com�n.

Pb-pb-b-b-b." With these magic vocables, Ralph the mouse revs up a dream come true--his very own motorcycle. Living in a knothole in a hotel room, young Ralph has seen plenty of families come and go, some more generous with their crumbs than others. But when young Keith and his parents check in to the hotel, Ralph gets his first chance to check out. He has always fantasized about venturing beyond the second floor, maybe even outside. Curiosity overcomes caution, and Ralph must have a go at Keith's toy motorcycle. Soon, the headstrong mouse finds himself in a pickle, when all he wanted was to ride a motorcycle. Lucky for him, the boy understands how it is. When he discovers Ralph in his thwarted attempt to abscond with the toy bike, Keith generously encourages the rodent to ride. He even teaches him the simple trick of starting the motorcycle: "You have to make a noise... pb-pb-b-b-b." The subsequent situations Ralph motors into require quick thinking and grownup-sized courage.

From the early days of raw corn liquor to the myriad distilleries that have proliferated around the country today, bourbon has come to symbolize America. In <i>Bourbon: The Rise, Fall, and Rebirth of an American Whiskey,</i> award-winning whiskey author Fred Minnick traces bourbon's entire history, from the 1700s with Irish, Scottish, and French settlers setting up stills and making distilled spirits in the New World through today's booming resurgence. He also lays out in expert detail the critical role this spirit has played throughout the cultural and even political history of the nation -- from Congress passing whiskey-protection laws to consumers standing in long lines just for a glimpse of a rare bottle of Pappy Van Winkle -- complemented by more than 100 illustrations and photos. And most importantly, Minnick explores the mystery of who most likely created the sweet corn liquor we now know as bourbon. He studies the men who've been championed as its inventors over time -- from Daniel Boone's cousin to Baptist minister Elijah Craig -- and, based on new research and never-before-seen documentation, answers the question of who deserves the credit.</p><p>"The book is a visual delight, sprinkled with hundreds of photos, side stories and Fast Facts ("In a 1921 American Medical Association survey, 51 percent of US physicians were in favor of prescribing whiskey."). You can ingest the book cover-to-cover or skip around, reading one day about the World War II "War on Slop" - distiller slang for grains left over from distillation - and the next day learning how terms like "bourbon" and "distiller" evolved." -- <b><i>Wine Buzz</i></b><p><b>Fred Minnick</b> is a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> best-selling author and the writer of award-winning books, such as <i>Bourbon Curious</i>, <i>Bourbon</i>, <i>Rum Curious</i>, and <i>Whiskey Women</i>.

You can visit Mike Lupica at mikelupicabooks.com<br>&nbsp;He knew he was small.<br><br>He just didn&#x2019;t think he was small.<br><br>Big difference.<br><br>Danny had known his whole life how small he was compared to everybody in his grade, from the first grade on. How he had been put in the front row, front and center, of every class picture taken. Been in the front of every line marching into every school assembly, first one through the door. Sat in the front of every classroom. Hey, little man. Hey, little guy. He was used to it by now. They&#x2019;d been studying DNA in science lately; being small was in his DNA. He&#x2019;d show up for soccer, or Little League baseball tryouts, or basketball, when he&#x2019;d first started going to basketball tryouts at the Y, and there&#x2019;d always be one of those clipboard dads who didn&#x2019;t know him, or his mom. Or his dad.<br><br>Asking him: &#x201c;Are you sure you&#x2019;re with the right group, little guy?&#x201d;<br><br>Meaning the right age group.<br><br>It happened the first time when he was eight, back when he still had to put the ball up on his shoulder and give it a heave just to get it up to a ten&#x2013;foot rim. When he&#x2019;d already taught himself how to lean into the bigger kid guarding him, just because there was always a bigger kid guarding him, and then step back so he could get his dopey shot off.<br><br>This was way back before he&#x2019;d even tried any fancy stuff, including the crossover.<br><br>He just told the clipboard dad that he was eight, that he was little, that this was his right group, and could he have his number, please? When he told his mom about it later, she just smiled and said, &#x201c;You know what you should hear when people start talking about your size? Blah blah blah.&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled back at her and said that he was pretty sure he would be able to remember that.<br>&#x201c;How did you play?&#x201d; she said that day, when she couldn&#x2019;t wait any longer for him to tell.<br><br>&#x201c;I did okay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have a feeling you did more than that,&#x201d; she said, hugging him to her. &#x201c;My streak of light.&#x201d;<br><br>Sometimes she&#x2019;d tell him how small his dad had been when he was Danny&#x2019;s age.<br><br>Sometimes not.<br><br>But here was the deal, when he added it all up: His height had always been much more of a stinking issue for other people, including his mom, than it was for him.<br><br>He tried not to sweat the small stuff, basically, the way grown&#x2013;ups always told you.<br><br>He knew he was faster than everybody else at St. Patrick&#x2019;s School. And at Springs School, for that matter. Nobody on either side of town could get in front of him. He was the best passer his age, even better than Ty Ross, who was better at everything in sports than just about anybody. He knew that when it was just kids&#x2014;which is the way kids always liked it in sports&#x2014;and the parents were out of the gym or off the playground and you got to just play without a whistle blowing every ten seconds or somebody yelling out more instructions, he was always one of the first picked, because the other guys on his team, the shooters especially, knew he&#x2019;d get them the ball.<br><br>Most kids, his dad told him one time, know something about basketball that even most grown&#x2013;ups never figure out.<br><br>One good passer changes everything.<br><br>Danny could pass, which is why he&#x2019;d always made the team.<br><br>Almost always.<br><br>But no matter what was happening with any team he&#x2019;d ever played on, no matter how tired he would be after practice, no matter how much homework he still had left, this driveway was still his special place. Like a special club with a membership of one, the place where he could come out at this time of night and imagine it up good, imagine it big and bright, even with just the one floodlight over the backboard and the other light, smaller, over the back door. His mother had done everything she could to make the driveway wider back here, even cutting into what little backyard they had the summer before last. &#x201c;I told them you needed more room in the corners,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The men from the paving company. They just nodded at me, like corners were some sort of crucial guy thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right up there with the remote control switcher for the TV,&#x201d; Danny said. &#x201c;And leaving wet towels on the bathroom floor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How are the corners now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Like at the Garden.&#x201d;<br><br>He had just enough room in the corners now, mostly for shooting. He didn&#x2019;t feel as if he was trying to make a drive to the basket in his closet. Or an elevator car. He had room to maneuver, pretend he really was at the real Garden, that he was one of the small fast guys who&#x2019;d made it all the way there. Like Muggsy Bogues, somebody he&#x2019;d read up on when one of his coaches told him to, who was only 5&#x2013;3 and made it to the NBA. Like Tiny Archibald and Bobby Hurley and Earl Boykins, a 5&#x2013;5 guy who came out of the basketball minor leagues, another streak of light who showed everybody that more than size mattered, even in hoops.<br><br>And, of course, Richie Walker.<br><br>Middletown&#x2019;s own.<br><br>Danny would put chairs out there and dribble through them like he was dribbling out the clock at the end of the game. Some nights he would borrow a pair of his mother&#x2019;s old sunglasses and tape the bottom part of the lens so he couldn&#x2019;t see the ball unless he looked straight down at it. This was back when he was first trying to perfect the double crossover, before he even had a chance to do it right, his hands being too little and his arms not being nearly long enough.<br><br>Sometimes he&#x2019;d be so dog tired when he finished&#x2014;though he would never cop to that with his mom&#x2014;he&#x2019;d fall into bed with his clothes on and nearly fall asleep that way.<br><br>&#x201c;You done?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say when she came in to say goodnight.<br><br>&#x201c;I finally got bored,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say, and she&#x2019;d say with a smile, <br><br>&#x201c;I always worry about that, you getting bored by basketball.&#x201d;<br><br>Everybody he&#x2019;d ever read up on, short or tall, had talked about how they outworked everybody else. Magic Johnson, he knew, won the championship his rookie season with the Lakers, scored forty&#x2013;two points in the final game of the championship series when he had to play center because Kareem Abdul&#x2013;Jabbar was hurt, then went back to East Lansing, Michigan, where he was from, in the summer and worked on his outside shooting because he&#x2019;d decided it wasn&#x2019;t good enough.<br><br>Tonight, Danny had worked past the time when his mom usually called him in, not even noticing how cold it had gotten for October. Worked underneath the new backboard she&#x2019;d gotten for him at the end of the summer. Not the only kid in his class with divorced parents now. Not the smallest kid on the court now. Just the only one. He&#x2019;d drive to the basket and then hit one of the chairs with one of his lookaway passes. Or he&#x2019;d step back and make a shot from the outside. Sometimes, breathing hard, like it was a real game, he&#x2019;d step to the free throw line he&#x2019;d drawn with chalk and make two free throws for the championship of something.<br><br>Just him and the ball and the feel of it in his hands and the whoosh of it going through the net and the sound one of the old wooden school chairs would make when he tipped it over with another bounce pass. He knew he was wearing out another pair of sneakers his mom called &#x201c;old school,&#x201d; which to Danny always meant &#x201c;on sale.&#x201d; Or that she had found his size at either the Nike store or the Reebok store at the factory outlet mall about forty&#x2013;five minutes from Middletown, both of them knowing she couldn&#x2019;t afford what Athlete&#x2019;s Foot or Foot Locker was charging for the new Kobe sneakers from Nike, or Iverson&#x2019;s, or McGrady&#x2019;s. Or the cool new LeBron James kicks that so many of the Springs School kids were wearing this year.<br><br>He finished the way he always did, trying to cleanly execute the crossover&#x2013;and&#x2013;back five times in a row, low enough to the ground to be like a rock he was skipping across Taylor Lake. Five times usually making it an official good night out here.<br><br>Except.<br><br>Except this was as far from a good night as he&#x2019;d ever known.<br><br>Basically, this was the worst night of his whole life.<br><br>Danny&#x2019;s mother, Ali, watched him from his bedroom window on the second floor, standing to the side of the window in the dark room, trying not to let him see her up here, even though she could see him sneaking a look occasionally, especially when he&#x2019;d do something fine down on the court, sink a long one or make a left&#x2013;handed layup or execute that tricky dribble he was always working on.<br><br>Sometimes he&#x2019;d do it right and come right out of it and be on his way to the basket, so fast she thought he should leave a puff of smoke like one of those old Roadrunner cartoons.<br><br>God, you&#x2019;re getting old, she thought. Did kids even know who the Roadrunner was anymore?<br><br>&#x201c;Nice work with that double dribble,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d tell him sometimes when he finally came in the house, tired even if he&#x2019;d never admit that to her.<br><br>&#x201c;Mom, you know it&#x2019;s not a double dribble. This&#x201d;&#x2014;showing her on the kitchen floor with the ball that was on its way up to his room with him&#x2014;&#x201c;is a double crossover.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever it is,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t do it in the kitchen.&#x201d;<br><br>That would get a smile out of her boy sometimes.<br><br>The boy who had cried when he told her his news tonight.<br><br>He was twelve now. And never let her see him cry unless he took a bad spill in a game or in the driveway, or got himself all tied up because he was afraid he was going to fail some test, even though he never did.<br><br>But tonight her son cried in the living room and let her hug him as she told him she hoped this was the worst thing that ever happened to him.<br><br>&#x201c;If it is,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re going to have an even happier life than I imagined for you.&#x201d;<br><br>She pushed back a little and smoothed out some of his blond hair, spikey now because he&#x2019;d been wearing one of his four thousand baseball caps while he played.<br><br>&#x201c;What do I always tell you?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Without looking up at her, reciting it like she was helping him learn his part in a school play, Danny said, &#x201c;Nobody imagines up things better than you do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There you go.&#x201d;<br><br>Another one of their games.<br><br>Except on this night he suddenly said, &#x201c;So how come you can&#x2019;t imagine a happier life for us now?&#x201d;<br><br>Then got up from the couch and ran out of the room and the next thing she heard was the bounce of the ball in the driveway. Like the real beat of his heart.<br><br>Or their lives.<br><br>She waited a while, cleaned up their dinner dishes, even though that never took long with just the two of them, finished correcting some test papers. Then she went up to his room and watched him try to play through this, the twelve&#x2013;year&#x2013;old who went through life being asked if he was ten, or nine, or eight.<br><br>Ali saw what she always saw, even tonight, when he was out here with the fierce expression on his face, hardly ever smiling, even as he dreamed his dreams, imagining for himself now, imagining up a happy life for himself, one where he wasn&#x2019;t always the smallest. One where all people saw was the size of his talent, all that speed, all the magic things he could do with a basketball in either hand.<br><br>No matter how much she tried not to, she saw all his father in him.<br><br>He was all the way past the house, on his way to making the right on Cleveland Avenue, when he saw the light at the end of the driveway, and saw the little boy back there.<br><br>He stopped the car.<br><br>Or maybe it stopped itself.<br><br>He was good at blaming, why not blame the car?<br><br>What was that old movie where Jack Nicholson played the retired astronaut? He couldn&#x2019;t remember the name, just that Shirley MacLaine was in it, too, and she was going around with Jack, and then her daughter got sick and the whole thing turned into a major chick flick.<br><br>There was this scene where Nicholson was trying to leave town, but the daughter was sick, and even though he didn&#x2019;t care about too much other than having fun, he couldn&#x2019;t leave because Shirley MacLaine needed him.<br><br>You think old Jack is out of there, adios, and then he shows up at the door, that smile on his face, and says, &#x201c;Almost a clean getaway.&#x201d;<br><br>He used to think his life was a movie. Enough people used to tell him that it was.<br><br>He parked near the corner of Cleveland and Earl, then walked halfway back up the block, across the street from 422 Earl, still wondering what he was doing on this street tonight, cruising this neighborhood, in this stupid small small&#x2013;minded town.<br><br>Watching this kid play ball.<br><br>Mesmerized, watching the way this kid, about as tall as his bad hip, could handle a basketball.<br><br>Watching him shoot his funny shot, pushing the ball off his shoulder like he was pushing a buddy over a fence. He seemed to miss as many shots as he made. But he never missed the folding chairs he was obviously using as imaginary teammates, whether he was looking at them when he fired one of his passes. Or not.<br><br>Watching the kid stop after a while, rearrange the chairs now, turning them into defenders, dribbling through them, controlling the ball better with his right hand than his left, keeping the ball low, only struggling when he tried to get tricky and double up on a crossover move.<br><br>The kid stopping sometimes, breathing hard, going through his little routine before making a couple of free throws.

How does it feel to hold someone&#x2019;s life in your hands, to cut into the stuff that creates thought, feeling and reason? How do you live with the consequences of performing a potentially lifesaving operation when it all goes wrong?</p><p>With astonishing compassion and candor, leading neurosurgeon Henry Marsh reveals the fierce joy of operating, the profoundly moving triumphs, the harrowing disasters, the haunting regrets and the moments of black humor that characterize a brain surgeon&#x2019;s life. <i>Do No Harm</i> provides unforgettable insight into the countless human dramas that take place in a busy modern hospital. Above all, it is a lesson in the need for hope when faced with life&#x2019;s most difficult decisions.</p></p><p><b>HENRY MARSH </b>studied medicine at the Royal Free Hospital in London, became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1984 and was appointed Consultant Neurosurgeon at Atkinson Morley's/St George's Hospital in London in 1987. He has been the subject of two documentary films, <i>Your Life in Their Hands</i>, which won the Royal Television Society Gold Medal, and <i>The English Surgeon</i>, which won an Emmy, and is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling memoir <i>Do No Harm and </i>NBCC finalist<i> Admissions</i>. He was made a CBE in 2010.<p>&#x201c;Neurosurgery has met its Boswell in Henry Marsh. Painfully honest about the mistakes that can 'wreck' a brain, exquisitely attuned to the tense and transient bond between doctor and patient, and hilariously impatient of hospital management, Marsh draws us deep into medicine's most difficult art and lifts our spirits. It's a superb achievement.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ian McEwan</i></p><p>&#x201c;His love for brain surgery and his patients shines through, but the specialty--shrouded in secrecy and mystique when he entered it--has now firmly had the rug pulled out from under it.

Brain surgery, that's the most remote thing for me, I don't know anything about it, and as it is with everything I'm ignorant of, I trust completely the skills of those who practice it, and tend to forget the human element, which is failures, misunderstandings, mistakes, luck and bad luck, but also the non-professional, everyday life that they have. <i>Do No Harm: Stories of Life, Death and Brain Surgery </i>by Henry Marsh reveals all of this, in the midst of life-threatening situations, and that's one reason to read it; true honesty in an unexpected place. But there are plenty of others &#x2013; for instance, the mechanical, material side of being, that we also are wire and strings that can be fixed, not unlike cars and washing machines, really.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Karl Ove Knausgaard, Financial Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;"<i>Do No Harm</i> is a penetrating, in-the-trenches look at the life of a modern day neurosurgeon.

Why then do we often find our lives so humdrum, so unadventuresome, so routine? Or else so frantic, so full of activity, but still devoid of fulfillment? How do we learn to risk, to trust, to pursue wholeness and excellence&#x2015;to run with the horses instead of shuffling along with the crowd? In a series of profound reflections on the life of Jeremiah the prophet, Eugene Peterson explores the heart of what it means to be fully and genuinely human. In his signature pastoral style, he invites readers to grasp the biblical truth that each person's story of faith is completely original. Peterson's writing is filled with humor and self-reflection, insight and wisdom, helping to set a course for others in the quest for life at its best. This special commemorative edition includes a new preface taken from Eric Peterson's homily at his father's memorial service, as well as a six-session Bible study guide for individuals or groups.</p><p>Eugene H. Peterson (1932&#x2013;2018) was a pastor, scholar, author, and poet. He wrote more than thirty books, including his widely acclaimed paraphrase of the Bible, <em>The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language</em>, his memoir, <em>The Pastor</em>, and the bestselling spiritual formation classic <em>A Long Obedience in the Same Direction</em>. Peterson was founding pastor of Christ Our King Presbyterian Church in Bel Air, Maryland, where he served for twenty-nine years before retiring in 1991. With degrees from Seattle Pacific, New York Theological Seminary, and Johns Hopkins University, he served as professor of spiritual theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia, until retiring in Lakeside, Montana, in 2006."In the last few years, Eugene's writing has kept me sane. <em>Run with the Horses</em> has been a powerful manual for me. It includes a lot of incendiary ideas. I hadn't really thought of Jeremiah as a performance artist. Why do we need art? Because if we're honest the only way that we can approach God is through metaphor, through symbol. Through <em>Run with the Horses</em> I learned about the prophet's work and it really changed me."

Snickers was known for being extremely playful, but up until that point, he&#x2019;d never swiped anyone&#x2019;s clothing before. Fortunately for me, it happened at eight in the morning on a Sunday, an hour before the park opened, so there were only two other people around when I got pantsed. Unfortunately, both of those other people were girls.<br> <br>One of them was my girlfriend, Summer McCracken, the fourteen-year-old daughter of the owner of FunJungle. The other was Olivia Putney, the dolphin trainer. Olivia was twenty-three, but she behaved in such a youthful, enthusiastic way that I often forgot she was ten years older than me.<br> <br>Dolphin Adventure was an enormous saltwater tank where tourists could pay to interact with the park&#x2019;s eight dolphins. Some less reputable dolphin encounters allowed tourists to ride on the animals, but FunJungle only let guests swim close by, feed the dolphins some fish, and pet them gently. Everyone loved it. The sessions were expensive&#x2014;and that was in addition to the steep price of park admission&#x2014;but Dolphin Adventure sold out almost every day.<br> <br>Summer and I had been swimming with the dolphins a lot lately. We had come for the first time a month before, when Summer had surprised me with a private swim for my birthday. Normally, guests swam in groups, but since we did it after official park hours, the two of us and Olivia had the dolphins all to ourselves. It was supposed to be a one-time event, but then Olivia had invited us to come back whenever we wanted&#x2014;so we had. Usually, we visited after the park closed; even though it was only April, central Texas could still be awfully hot in the evenings and the dolphin tank was refreshingly cool. No one ever charged us, even though Summer could easily afford it. It was one of the perks of being the owner&#x2019;s daughter. The trainers claimed it wasn&#x2019;t a big deal; one of them always had to be there before opening and after closing anyhow, and they said the stimulation we provided was good for the dolphins. They even gave us our own employee lockers to store bathing suits and towels, so we didn&#x2019;t have to lug our stuff home and back each time.<br> <br>We hadn&#x2019;t really meant to go swimming that morning. We had really come to FunJungle to see Li Ping. The five-year-old panda&#x2019;s arrival was a huge deal. Most animals were owned by their zoos, but every panda in the world was owned by the country of China, which only loaned them to a few select zoos around the world. Other animals could attract crowds, but nothing else on earth was as rare, adorable, and beloved as a giant panda. The fact that one was coming to FunJungle had boosted ticket presales for the entire summer.<br> <br>Li Ping was supposed to be there at 8:00 a.m., but Summer and I had arrived much earlier. That wasn&#x2019;t a big deal for me, since my family actually lived at FunJungle. (Both of my parents worked for the park&#x2014;Mom was the head primatologist, while Dad was the official photographer&#x2014;so we lived in employee housing beyond the back fence.) Summer lived twenty miles away, but she and her father weren&#x2019;t about to miss something this momentous. Unfortunately, the truck with Li Ping got stuck in a major traffic jam on I-10, delaying the panda&#x2019;s arrival at least an hour. Even that early in the morning, it was already hot, so Summer had said that, instead of just sitting around, we might as well go see the dolphins.<br> <br>A few months before, J.J. McCracken would have had a bodyguard tail Summer to the dolphin tank, but Summer had always chafed at this. Having enormous men constantly following her made it difficult to have a normal social life. So she&#x2019;d begged her father to stop hiring them, pointing out that, so far, the guards had actually caused more problems than they&#x2019;d solved. (The last one had been complicit in a crime at FunJungle.) J.J. had reluctantly agreed on a trial basis, which had worked out so far.<br> <br>When Summer and I reached Dolphin Adventure, we found Olivia on duty, feeding the dolphins a breakfast of raw squid and herring. She was wearing her standard Dolphin Adventure bathing suit and her hair was wet, indicating that she&#x2019;d already been in the tank. Olivia didn&#x2019;t even bother asking if we wanted to swim. She simply said, &#x201c;Hop on in, kids! The water&#x2019;s fine!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds good,&#x201d; Summer replied, then told me, &#x201c;Last one in is a sea cucumber!&#x201d; and bolted for her locker. We quickly changed into our bathing suits, grabbed scuba masks, and hit the water. Summer beat me by five seconds. A bit earlier in the year, we might have needed neoprene suits to keep warm, but it was hot enough that day to go in without them.<br> <br>The dolphin tank was an oval pool twelve feet deep and a quarter mile in circumference. It was divided into two sections: one for the dolphins to interact with guests and a much larger area to be on their own. The interaction area was fronted by a long man-made beach built with sand that had been trucked in from South Padre Island. A floating catwalk separated the two areas on the surface, with a small island in the center of the tank. Under the surface, though, there were no barriers. The dolphins were always free to go wherever they wanted. If they felt like ignoring us&#x2014;or any guests&#x2014;they could simply swim away.<br> <br>Two of them, Snickers and his sister, Twix, raced right over to us, eager to play. Bottlenose dolphins are extremely social and the siblings knew us well. They swam all around us, leaping over our heads and corkscrewing through the water below. Snickers kept rolling onto his back, eager to have his belly rubbed, like a 400-pound aquatic poodle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Want to see something cool?&#x201d; Olivia asked us, after we&#x2019;d been in long enough for our fingers to start pruning. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve taught Twix a new behavior. Check this out.&#x201d; She stepped onto the floating catwalk and blew into a small silver whistle she kept on a chain around her neck. Twix zipped over to her.<br> <br>Dolphins&#x2019; personalities are as varied as humans&#x2019; are. Twix was much more acrobatic than the others, able to do all sorts of amazing tricks, like double flips with a twist. Snickers was far more impish, always looking for ways to steal fish from the trainers. Their mother, Skittles, had the most vocalizations of any dolphin at FunJungle; in addition to whistles, grunts, clicks, and clacks, she could make an incredible variety of farting noises with her blowhole.<br> <br>Olivia blew her whistle again.<br> <br>Twix bobbed upright with her head out of the water.<br> <br>Olivia then clenched her hand into a fist.<br> <br>Twix promptly spit a mouthful of water over the wall.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cool!&#x201d; Summer exclaimed. &#x201c;Can I try it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; Olivia tossed a handful of squid into Twix&#x2019;s mouth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to see if she&#x2019;ll do it for other people.&#x201d; She blew into her whistle once more and pointed toward us.<br> <br>Twix shot back through the tank to where we were treading water and came to a sudden stop in front of Summer, sticking her head above the surface.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, Twixie,&#x201d; Summer said. &#x201c;When I give you the signal, spit at Teddy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; I protested.<br> <br>&#x201c;One,&#x201d; Summer counted. &#x201c;Two&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before she could get to three, I raised my hand and made a fist. Twix promptly spit a mouthful of water into Summer&#x2019;s face instead of mine.<br> <br>Most people assumed I liked Summer because she was rich, beautiful, and famous. They were wrong. I liked Summer because she was the coolest, smartest, most down-to-earth girl I&#x2019;d ever met. (Although her being rich, beautiful, and famous were all nice perks.) For example, a lot of girls might have been upset to have a giant marine mammal spit on them. But Summer thought it was funny. She spluttered a bit, laughing the whole time&#x2014;then pounced on me and tried to dunk me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going down for that!&#x201d; she warned.<br> <br>I caught her arms in mid-attack and we ended up wrestling, each trying to shove the other one under the water. Snickers seemed to feed off our energy, spiraling around us in the pool. He even nudged us a few times, like he wanted to join in the fun.<br> <br>And then, he grabbed my bathing suit in his teeth and dove, yanking it right off me.<br> <br>I was suddenly buck naked except for my scuba mask. Needless to say, this caught me by surprise. I forgot all about wrestling. Summer, who hadn&#x2019;t noticed I&#x2019;d been stripped, promptly dunked me. She shoved me under and crowed victoriously.<br> <br>Below the surface, I spotted Snickers speeding to the farthest end of the tank, my bathing suit clenched firmly in his mouth. It didn&#x2019;t look like I was going to get it back anytime soon.<br> <br>I promptly cupped my hands over my privates and bobbed back to the surface.<br> <br>&#x201c;I got you gooood,&#x201d; Summer taunted, still unaware of what had happened. &#x201c;And you are not getting me back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; I agreed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Summer cocked her head at me curiously. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna let me get away with that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, yes. I&#x2019;m feeling very chivalrous.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t so chivalrous when you made Snickers spit in my face,&#x201d; Summer told me. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; I said, a bit too quickly.<br> <br>Summer might have pressed on suspiciously if her cell phone hadn&#x2019;t rung. She&#x2019;d left it on the fake beach with her towel, and it now chimed loudly with the specific ringtone that indicated her father was calling.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Daddy!&#x201d; Summer exclaimed, then checked her watch. &#x201c;Oh man, we&#x2019;ve been here longer than I thought! I&#x2019;ll bet Li Ping&#x2019;s almost here!&#x201d; She swam for the beach.<br> <br>I stayed right where I was, trying to figure out how to get out of the pool without revealing I was naked.<br> <br>Now Olivia grew suspicious too. Thankfully, from where she was standing on the catwalk, she couldn&#x2019;t see too well below the surface of the water, so she hadn&#x2019;t noticed my nakedness yet either. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to see the panda?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d take a little extra time with the dolphins,&#x201d; I replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can swim with the dolphins whenever you want,&#x201d; Olivia pointed out. &#x201c;A giant panda doesn&#x2019;t show up every day.&#x201d;<br> <br>Normally, this would have been a good point. However, even though I was excited to see Li Ping, I wasn&#x2019;t excited for the two girls to see me naked. Or to even learn that I was naked.<br> <br>Only, that was getting harder and harder to keep a secret. Summer had now reached the beach. As she checked the message from her father, she realized I was still back in the pool. &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; she demanded. &#x201c;Daddy says Li Ping will be here in fifteen minutes! We&#x2019;ve gotta bolt.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You go ahead,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll catch up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going without you,&#x201d; Summer insisted, then asked, &#x201c;Why are you treading water so funny?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d; I asked innocently.<br> <br>Summer&#x2019;s jaw dropped as she finally realized why my hands were cupped over my privates. &#x201c;Oh my gosh. Did you lose your bathing suit?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I lied.<br> <br>At which point, Snickers ambushed me from below. He&#x2019;d returned from hiding my bathing suit and was still in a rambunctious mood. Dolphins are surprisingly powerful. With only a few strokes of their tails, they can launch their entire bodies ten feet out of the water. Or plow into a great white shark hard enough to kill it. Or, it turned out, fling a thirteen-year-old boy fifteen feet through the air. Snickers drove his head right under my rear end and flicked me upward. The next thing I knew, I was flying. In my surprise, I let go of my privates and windmilled my arms in the air, allowing Summer and Olivia ample opportunity to see that I was completely naked. Then I belly flopped back into the water.<br> <br>When I resurfaced, Summer and Olivia were laughing hysterically. So was Snickers. The dolphin&#x2019;s laughter sounded more like rapid-fire clicking, but I definitely got the sense that he knew what he&#x2019;d done was funny. To everyone but me, at least.<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened to your suit?&#x201d; Summer asked, though she was laughing so hard she could barely speak.<br> <br>&#x201c;That jerk stole it!&#x201d; I exclaimed, pointing at Snickers.<br> <br>Snickers apparently didn&#x2019;t like being insulted. He promptly flipped his tail, dousing me with a wave of water.<br> <br>Summer laughed even harder.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not funny,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes it is,&#x201d; she informed me. &#x201c;In fact, it&#x2019;s very funny. And I guarantee you, if I&#x2019;d lost my bathing suit in there, you&#x2019;d be laughing.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t reply to that, because it was probably true. Instead, I said, &#x201c;Could you two turn away so I can get my towel?&#x201d;<br> <br>Summer and Olivia both averted their eyes. Snickers hit me with another wave of water.<br> <br>I clambered out onto the beach and quickly wrapped my towel around me.<br> <br>Summer started for the women&#x2019;s changing room, where she&#x2019;d left her dry clothes. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s move it. Li Ping&#x2019;s gonna be here soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m drying off as fast as I can,&#x201d; I told her.<br> <br>The changing rooms were to the side of the beach, next to a small building where guests checked in for their dolphin swims. Both structures had thatched roofs to give the impression that we were on some tropical island, rather than two hundred miles from the ocean. The walls of the changing room didn&#x2019;t even go all the way up to the thatch, so we could easily talk back and forth between them. As I rinsed off the salt water in the men&#x2019;s shower, Olivia called to me from outside the door. &#x201c;Teddy! How did Snickers get your swimsuit off?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He just grabbed on to it with his teeth and yanked it down!&#x201d; I yelled back. &#x201c;Then he swam away with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hmmm,&#x201d; Olivia said, like something was bothering her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is something wrong?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s never done that before,&#x201d; Olivia said. &#x201c;And none of the other dolphins have either, so he couldn&#x2019;t have learned it from them. I wonder where he got the idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>I turned off the water and grabbed my towel. &#x201c;He couldn&#x2019;t have figured it out himself?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s possible,&#x201d; Olivia replied, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s highly unlikely. There are two types of dolphin behaviors: natural ones and learned ones. A natural one would be something with a purpose, like leaping out of the water&#x2014;while one that&#x2019;s learned is more of a trick, like doing a backflip. Stealing someone&#x2019;s bathing suit doesn&#x2019;t seem like it&#x2019;d have much natural purpose to a dolphin, and it&#x2019;s a little complicated, so my guess is it was learned.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold on,&#x201d; Summer said from the women&#x2019;s room. &#x201c;Are you saying one of the trainers taught Snickers to do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope not,&#x201d; Olivia said. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t think I can let Snickers interact with the public for the time being. If he strips the suit off a paying guest, we could get sued.&#x201d;<br> <br>I yanked on my dry clothes and exited the changing room. &#x201c;How could someone else have taught the dolphins to do anything? No one has access to the dolphins except the trainers, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No one else is supposed to have access,&#x201d; Olivia corrected. &#x201c;But maybe someone does.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re worried they&#x2019;ll teach all the dolphins to strip the guests?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Actually, I&#x2019;m more worried that someone&#x2019;s been in with the dolphins without authorization. Maybe they didn&#x2019;t really try to teach Snickers to pants people, but it still happened somehow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dolphins pick up behaviors all the time without necessarily being taught them. They can learn things just by interacting with guests. When the trainers are here, we can try to make sure they don&#x2019;t pick u...</p><h2>Soul Fuel: A Daily Devotional</h2><p><p>Bestselling author Bear Grylls is best known for his seven seasons on National Geographic's <em>Man vs. Wild</em>, his current NBC TV series, <em>Running Wild with Bear Grylls</em>, and his adventures climbing ice cliffs, running through forest fires, and parachuting from balloons.

She lives in the Shetland Islands.K-Gr 3&#x2014;The authors deliver an eloquent environmental message while demonstrating how kids can change the world through teamwork and perseverance. When Vivienne moves into her new home by the sea, she is nervous about finding her way. Her teacher and her classmates welcome her as they jump into an exciting class project&#x2014;the students are looking for a problem to solve. After school at the beach, Vivienne and her new friend, Clementine, discover that the baby loggerhead sea turtles that are about to hatch may need help making it down to the ocean. The newborn turtles instinctively move toward the strongest light they see, and the brightly lit beach houses could point them in the wrong direction. Vivienne is determined to help the tiny creatures. The students in Mr. J.'s class begin working on the project by gathering information. How will they convince the homeowners along the shoreline to turn off their lights? The children soon involve the entire town as they launch their Lights Out for Loggerheads campaign. By showing the multiple channels that the students work through to raise awareness (posters, fliers, bake sales, a town meeting, the local newspaper, and the Internet), the authors expose readers to accessible, affordable ways to raise issue awareness in communities. So's lovely and bright watercolor illustrations chronicle each stage of the children's cause. The artist deftly captures the energy and enthusiasm in the classroom and the tranquility of the shoreline. The shadowy scene on the darkened beach as the turtles emerge from their nests is particularly atmospheric. VERDICT This collaboration provides an excellent example of how kids can make a difference through careful research, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Pair it with the equally inspiring Nights of the Pufflings by Bruce McMillan.&#x2014;Linda L.

But the sound wouldn&#x2019;t come and the nightmare only continued, forcing Owen to ask himself, deep down, one question:<br> <br>&#x201c;Can anyone tell me what three-fourths times two-thirds is?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Barberry stood at the board at the front of Owen&#x2019;s classroom, his arms folded, waiting for a hand to raise.<br> <br>No, not that question. The real question was this: Was there anything in the world that could possibly be more boring than fractions? Owen frowned as Mr. Barberry gave up on volunteers and just picked someone. &#x201c;Mari? Three-fourths times two-thirds?&#x201d;<br> <br>Being locked in a room with no windows or doors, without anything to do, while wearing a blindfold and being forced to name various types of trees? That&#x2019;d be pretty boring, but not fractions boring.<br> <br>&#x201c;One-half,&#x201d; Mari answered, and Mr. Barberry nodded.<br> <br>Maybe if someone gave you enough soda to keep you awake for hours, then read furniture building instructions to you? In another language?<br> <br>Except what if you accidentally started to learn that foreign language without realizing it? That&#x2019;d almost be considered worth it to some people. So that was instantly out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Owen?&#x201d; Mr. Barberry said. &#x201c;How about you? One-third times two-thirds.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two-ninths?&#x201d; Owen said, faking enthusiasm.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Mr. Barberry said, and turned back to the board while Owen let his mind wander again.<br> <br>Maybe being stuck home sick and too feverish to think or do anything except watch TV, and the only channel that came in was an infomercial for other infomercials. That would be pretty boring.<br> <br>&#x201c;One-third times one-third?&#x201d; Mr. Barberry asked. &#x201c;Gabriel?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;One-ninth?&#x201d; Gabriel answered, his eyes glazed over.<br> <br>Nope, fractions still won. And by a lot.<br> <br>If only the bell would ring early from some freak electrical surge. Sure, it had never happened before, but Owen was nothing if not optimistic. And that was something he was pretty proud of, since it wasn&#x2019;t easy to be optimistic in the face of all these math problems.<br> <br>&#x201c;How about four-fifths times one-eighth?&#x201d; Mr. Barberry asked. &#x201c;Bethany, want to take this one?&#x201d;<br> <br>There was no answer, so Mr. Barberry turned around. &#x201c;Bethany?&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen threw a look over his shoulder and saw Bethany hunched down behind her math book, her head not even visible. She wasn&#x2019;t actually sleeping, was she? That&#x2019;d be brave. Dumb, but brave.<br> <br>Either way, at least something was happening, and that meant class got just a fraction less boring. Owen covered his smile with his hand. Fraction. Ha!<br> <br>&#x201c;Bethany!&#x201d; Mr. Barberry shouted.<br> <br>Bethany jerked back in her chair, and her math book tumbled forward, revealing something else behind it: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br> <br>Uh-oh.<br> <br>Mr. Barberry just glared at Bethany for a second as she looked around, a mix of confusion and fear on her face. Owen winced, waiting for Mr. Barberry to start yelling, but fortunately the bell rang right at that moment, releasing them for lunch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, go,&#x201d; Mr. Barberry said. &#x201c;Everyone but you, Bethany.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl nodded, her long bronze-colored hair falling forward over her face. Owen threw a sympathetic look back at her, then noticed something weird.<br> <br>Was that chocolate on her chin?<br> <br>But then the other students blocked his view, and he shrugged, not willing to chance getting yelled at too. Besides, lunch meant at least he had a half hour of no fractions.<br> <br>After waiting in a lunch line that he&#x2019;d have to remember to add to his list of the most boring things ever, Owen carried his tray of pizza and milk around the cafeteria, looking for a seat. He considered one table with some boys from his class, but they ignored him as he walked over, so he kept going, pretending he&#x2019;d always meant to sit by himself.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s why he brought a book, anyway. Sitting by himself wasn&#x2019;t exactly new.<br> <br>Owen had read Kiel Gnomenfoot and the End of Everything twice now, but the seventh book in the series was coming out next week, so it couldn&#x2019;t hurt to catch up. It&#x2019;d been hard enough getting a copy out of the library anyway, despite the fact that his mother worked there. This was the book that ended with Dr. Verity surprise attacking the Magister, Kiel&#x2019;s teacher, after all. Owen personally knew at least five people who had cried at the idea that the Magister might die. And ten people who called the series a Harry Potter rip-off, which it sort of was, but everyone still loved it.<br> <br>As Owen started to read the last chapter, where Dr. Verity broke into the Magister&#x2019;s upside-down tower, he saw Bethany stomp into the cafeteria out of the corner of his eye. She plopped down at a table on the other side of the room, then pulled out her book and looked around suspiciously. Then she dropped her head, ate something, and sat back up, glancing around again.<br> <br>What was she doing? Eating behind the book? Did she even have food? Was she&#x2014;<br> <br>Whoops. What she was now, was staring at him.<br> <br>Owen immediately looked everywhere but at Bethany, but it was too late. She slammed her book closed, threw him a dirty look, then exited the cafeteria with an annoyed huff.<br> <br>Owen sighed and dropped his own book onto the table. She was probably feeling embarrassed after getting yelled at and didn&#x2019;t want anyone staring at her, which meant he&#x2019;d just made things worse. Awesome.<br> <br>His guilt pushed Owen up out of his seat and after Bethany to apologize or make a joke. Only, by the time he got to the hallway, there was no Bethany. In fact, the entire hallway was completely empty, except for the copy of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Bethany had just been reading, which now lay on the floor just beneath a locker.<br> <br>Huh? Not only had she just left her book on the floor, but worse, Owen could tell even from a distance that it came from his mom&#x2019;s library. That wasn&#x2019;t even her book!<br> <br>And were those chocolate stains on it?<br> <br>That was not cool. What was Bethany thinking? Who checked out a book and got chocolate all over it, even if it, you know, fit the story? Other people wanted to read these books too, and didn&#x2019;t want to have food stains on their copy.<br> <br>Shaking his head, Owen grabbed the book and dropped it into his bag, then walked back into the cafeteria to get back to important things, like Dr. Verity&#x2019;s attack on the Magister. Unfortunately, the bell decided to ring then&#x2014;cruel, but expected. Owen sighed, threw away his garbage, and tromped back to another few hours of mind-numbing semi-learning.<br> <br>Eventually, mercifully, the day ended, and Owen exploded out the front door like he was launched from a cannon. It felt so good to be out that he walked that much quicker to his mother&#x2019;s library, where she worked almost every night. As usual, Owen would go by and help out where he could, mostly because she made him, but partly because it was just fun being around all the books.<br> <br>He said hi to his mom, who was running around with too much to do, then took his usual spot at the front desk, where he checked people&#x2019;s books out for a few hours. This job could be either interesting (seeing what people were reading), embarrassing (seeing what people were reading), or boring (seeing what people were reading). Usually it managed to cover at least two of the three every few minutes, and tonight was no different.<br> <br>When things finally cooled down, Owen sighed and pulled out his homework, knowing that his mother, no matter how busy she was, would notice he wasn&#x2019;t busy and make him do it anyway. Only, when he went to pull out his math book, there was Bethany&#x2019;s copy of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in his bag.<br> <br>Um, whoops. He&#x2019;d sort of forgotten all about that. He&#x2019;d picked it up meaning to give it back to Bethany and glare at her judgmentally for the chocolate stains. But now that he thought about it, had she even been in science after lunch? He couldn&#x2019;t remember her being there, or in any other class that afternoon. Maybe she&#x2019;d gone home sick after eating too much chocolate and using a library book as a napkin.<br> <br>Owen shrugged and checked the book back in to the library. She knew where to find it if she wanted it again.<br> <br>His mother caught him putting the book on a pile that was supposed to go back out onto shelves, and gave him a look. He sighed and stood up, knowing where this was going. &#x201c;Those all go in the children&#x2019;s section,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m locking up, but I have a few things to take care of in the office after that, so finish your homework when you&#x2019;re done.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ugh. Of course. Owen picked up a pile of books about half as tall as he was, then walked them slowly back to the children&#x2019;s section.<br> <br>As usual, it was a mess, like a hurricane had plowed into a nuclear bomb right around the Rick Riordan books. Owen sighed and dug in, pulling a few interesting books aside as he noticed them. That was the only good part about cleanup&#x2014;he&#x2019;d sometimes find things that looked like a good read.<br> <br>Ten minutes later the children&#x2019;s section was at least cleaner, with random piles stacked on top of over-full shelves. Owen looked sadly at the stack of books he&#x2019;d carried here to put back, then sighed again and picked up Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, knowing there&#x2019;d be no room for it.<br> <br>But then, as he found the D section for Roald Dahl, something weird happened. His hand . . . jumped.<br> <br>He looked down at his hand and the book in it, thinking he&#x2019;d just imagined the jolt.<br> <br>The book in his hand jumped again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gah!&#x201d; he said, dropping the book. It smacked the floor hard and just sat there for a moment.<br> <br>Then it jumped a third time.<br> <br>What was happening? Owen backed away as the cover and a bunch of pages flipped open all by themselves. Was the book haunted? Was the entire library haunted? Was it okay to find that awesome even while being scared?<br> <br>And then, the last thing in the world that Owen ever expected happened.<br> <br>Five chocolate-covered fingers pushed right out of the center of the book, grabbed the edge, and began to pull themselves out.</p><h2>Microbiology For Dummies</h2><p><p><i>Microbiology For Dummies</i> (9781119544425) was previously published as <i>Microbiology For Dummies</i> (9781118871188).

Coaching coaches one-on-one and in small groups, she enjoys a front-row seat as remarkable agile coaches emerge and go on to entice the very best from the teams they coach. Prior to agile, Adkins had more than fifteen years of expertise leading project teams and groups of project managers in large and small consulting firms, commercial software companies, and the <i>Fortune</i> 500, yet nothing prepared her for the power of agile done simply and well. She teaches the &#x201c;Coaching Agile Teams&#x201d; training course, which allows agile coaches to learn, practice, and deepen the skills and mind-sets offered in the book.&#x201c; The subtitle of this book says it is for &#x2018;ScrumMasters, Agile Coaches, and Project Managers,&#x2019; however, its guidance and advice extend to anyone associated with an agile (Scrum) team. It will also certainly help team members better understand their relationship to the work ScrumMasters, agile coaches, and project managers do for the team. And, beyond this, the book can be valuable to anyone working in a coaching capacity with any group of people, expanding the book&#x2019;s application beyond agile-based efforts.&#x201d; <i> <p>&#x2014;Scott Duncan, Agile Coach</p> </i> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c; Lyssa explains brilliantly how skills from professional coaching can be applied to coaching agile software development teams. What I love about this book is how Lyssa brings practical advice to life by relating it to everyday experiences we all recognize. An essential guide for every agile manager&#x2019;s bookshelf.&#x201d;</p> <p> <i>&#x2014;Rachel Davies, author of </i>Agile Coaching</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c; As I read this book I could actually hear Lyssa&#x2019;s voice, guiding me and sparking precious &#x2018;a-ha moments.&#x2019; This truly is the next best thing to having an experienced and wise coach sitting by your side, helping you be the best coach you can be for your team.&#x201d;</p> <p> <i>&#x2014;Kris Blake, agile coach</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c; Lyssa Adkins presents agile coaching in a gentle style with firm underpinnings. She resolves the paradox of how coaching can help a team to self-organize, and shows how a nurturing environment can push teams to perform better than ever.&#x201d;</p> <p> <i>&#x2014;Bill Wake, Industrial Logic, Inc.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c; I love Lyssa&#x2019;s three qualities of an agile coach&#x2014;loving, compassionate, uncompromising&#x2014;sweet. Every chapter offers a compelling blend of philosophy and action, framework and freedom, approach and avoidance, as any agile book should. <b> <i>Coaching Agile Teams</i> </b>is a good candidate to become dog-eared on my desktop rather than looking good on my bookshelf.

This book encapsulates her thoughts and ideas into a fantastic literary work that, I believe, fills a void in our community. We knew the role of a coach was needed, but for a long time we were not sure what that role actually was. We struggled as a community to explain what to do, when to do it, and what to do next. Lyssa not only collates all of the things we as coaches aspire to be, but has provided some great advice with realistic direction on how to be the best coach you can be for your team.&#x201d;</p> <p> <i>&#x2014;Martin Kearns, CSC + CST, Principal Consultant, Renewtek ply.

The students include top amateurs, aspiring tour players, and recreational golfers&#x2014;among them lawyers, filmmakers, bankers, opera singers, corporate executives, and teachers. All of them love golf. All of them want to improve and enjoy the game. But more often than not, they admit to being frustrated with golf&#x2014;and with themselves. Sadly, some are just about ready to quit.<br> <br>Listen to a few of our students. We always begin by asking them to introduce themselves and to say a few words about why they&#x2019;ve come.<br> <br>Janice, from Vancouver, British Columbia: &#x201c;I love golf when I play well, but I really struggle when I&#x2019;m playing poorly. I wonder if it&#x2019;s possible to have fun even when I&#x2019;m having a bad day.&#x201d;<br> <br>Joe, from Minneapolis, Minnesota: &#x201c;I feel frustrated most of the time I&#x2019;m on the course. I&#x2019;d like to learn how to be more relaxed and spend less time thinking about the mechanics of my swing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Beth, from Boston, Massachusetts, a retired finance executive: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very analytical and goal-oriented. I want to get out of my head and feel more joy when I play.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mia, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who is a college golfer: &#x201c;The biggest thing I&#x2019;m looking for is to improve my consistency. After rounds when I played well I think, That was so easy. But after a bad round I&#x2019;m thinking, That was the hardest thing I&#x2019;ve ever done.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bob, from Portland, Oregon: &#x201c;My main objective and desire is to get the most out of myself. I want to feel I can improve and continue to grow my golf game.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lana, who lives in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and Palm Desert, California: &#x201c;I love golf, but I never feel like I&#x2019;m improving. And I fight the feeling that not improving reflects on me as a person.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mike, from Scottsdale, Arizona, a businessman: &#x201c;I want to be able to manage myself better when I play with my weekend foursome. They talk so much: I can&#x2019;t even concentrate. I play like Jekyll and Hyde when I&#x2019;m with them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ida, from Kansas City, Missouri: &#x201c;I so want to enjoy golf. When I don&#x2019;t play well, I beat myself up and have a terrible rest of the day.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zach, from New York City, a 1-handicap player: &#x201c;Instead of always thinking about my swing, I want to learn to let myself play the game.&#x201d;<br> <br>Julie, from Indiana, a nationally ranked amateur: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to be so scared when I&#x2019;m playing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jane, from New York: &#x201c;I want to figure out why I get so tight when I&#x2019;m hitting over water. I moan and groan a lot on the course. I don&#x2019;t want to be that kind of golfer.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patrick, from New Jersey, who works in venture capital: &#x201c;I practice and take lessons, but I never seem to get any better. Most days, I come off the course completely deflated. I don&#x2019;t want to start all over. I&#x2019;d like to take my game&#x2014;the one I have now&#x2014;to the next level.&#x201d;<br> <br>The sentiments of the comments capture the mood we see in today&#x2019;s golfers&#x2014;whether they are American, European, or Asian. Though club technology, fitness training, and the science of the swing have improved exponentially over the past decade, many golfers have not improved and have been leaving the game. The numbers have declined for several reasons, from a shortage of playing time and budget considerations, to difficulty in learning the game and courses that are too challenging. In short, golfers are stuck&#x2014;and their lack of improvement might be a more alarming development for the game. According to the National Golf Foundation, nearly six million people in the U.S. quit the sport between 2003 and 2015.<br> <br>We think we know another big reason why players are frustrated. Many golfers struggle to transfer their games from the range to the course. We see players making good contact in practice, but when we&#x2019;re watching them on the course, they take three times longer to hit the ball&#x2014;with a completely different technical swing. All of a sudden, they can&#x2019;t hit the ball. Their physical, mental, and emotional states have changed because performing on the golf course means something. There are actual consequences to what they do.<br> <br>Consider this: What if you arrive at a tennis court or a basketball court and see a sign that reads: NO PRACTICING ON THE COURT. Or at a swimming pool, the lifeguard tells you, &#x201c;Sorry, no practicing your breast stroke in the pool.&#x201d; Many golf courses and clubs have similar rules, ostensibly to protect pace of play and the conditions of the course.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s what we believe: Practicing golf shots and playing golf on the course are not incompatible. To learn a sport, you need to learn in the context of the sport with all its constraints. Only in this state can you learn the skills that are required in the real environment of the game.<br> <br>In addition to teaching the mechanics of a pitch shot on the range, golfers need to learn to hit that shot on the course, and then how to hit it a little higher to get over a bunker or a bush (and with only one try!). Let&#x2019;s say there&#x2019;s a tree in front of you. You need to get the ball around the tree. The first time you try, you&#x2019;ll probably stick the ball in the trunk of the tree. But with exploration and practice, you&#x2019;ll figure out how to navigate around the tree. All of a sudden, you&#x2019;ve learned to curve the ball. You&#x2019;ve learned to play.<br> <br>The bottom line is that you have to be in the pool to learn how to swim, you have to be on a tennis court to learn to play tennis, and you have to be on the golf course to learn the game. You need to dedicate time on the course when you&#x2019;re not focused on keeping score. You need to be on the course to discover what works. (And we promise, doing so will not hold up play or leave hundreds of divots.) Only on the course will you truly develop your skills, your game&#x2014;and yourself.<br> <br>A related issue we&#x2019;ve observed is that when golfers (of any level) struggle on the course, they tend to blame their technique. Players today have become entirely too focused on the swing, with its angles and planes, speeds and smash factors. Tour pros now spend hours analyzing their swings with video cameras and TrackMan-style launch-monitor devices. (These instruments measure everything from clubhead speed to ball speed and flight apex to the forces and pressures of the feet during the swing.) Amateur golfers are convinced they&#x2019;ll shoot lower scores once they&#x2019;ve figured out whether they&#x2019;re one-plane or two-plane swingers. They debate swing theories&#x2014;X-factor, Stack-and-Tilt, A-Swing&#x2014;as if one is the right answer. They read magazine articles that promise to teach the correct swing method that will fix everything. Meanwhile, they pursue the elusive secret of the swing via instructional apps and the wide array of analytical resources, such as K-VESTs, FocusBands, and clip-on metronomes. As one of our students put it, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve taken in so much information, I feel like my head is exploding.&#x201d;<br> <br>We want to make it clear that we&#x2019;re not dismissing the benefit of modern technology or the importance of a sound golf swing. It&#x2019;s imperative that you have a reliable swing that fits your body. You need to practice it enough, so you are confident and can execute it proficiently. You also need to know which situations call for a certain shot. Even so, we believe there&#x2019;s an important distinction. It&#x2019;s not just about the swing. It&#x2019;s about the golfer who makes the swing on the course.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a book we like called The Dude and the Zen Master. It&#x2019;s a series of conversations between the actor Jeff Bridges and a Zen master named Bernie Glassman. Glassman was an aeronautical engineer who became a teacher of Buddhism in Los Angeles. In the book, Bernie and Jeff discuss a variety of subjects, from movies to family to learning to, well, simply, being human. Bernie tells Jeff that he knows a little ditty that contains one of the secrets to life:<br> <br>Row, row, row your boat,<br> <br>Gently down the stream,<br> <br>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,<br> <br>Life is but a dream.<br> <br>He asks Jeff to imagine getting into a boat for the first time and trying to figure out how to row. Should he put the right oar into the water first or the left? What should he be doing with his shoulders during the stroke? What about his arms? How can he get the oars to work together? What if he wants to row to the opposite shore? If he fixates on the destination, he might forget to pay attention to his rowing mechanics. But if he fixates on his rowing, he could lose focus on where he wants to go.<br> <br>Bernie explains that, according to Zen philosophy, the opposite shore is actually right under your feet. So the question isn&#x2019;t, How do you get from here to there? The question is, How do you get from here to here? How do you become fully present in the moment, in your environment, and in the activity in which you&#x2019;re engaged?<br> <br>Bernie advises Jeff, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get down on yourself because you&#x2019;re not an expert rower right away. Don&#x2019;t go learn to row in a performance tank. Just ease your boat into the water and begin to row&#x2014;very gently&#x2014;down the stream.&#x201d;<br> <br>IN OUR PREVIOUS BOOKS, Every Shot Must Have a Purpose, The Game Before the Game, and Play Your Best Golf Now, we introduced the elements of our teaching: Shot-making with purpose and commitment, practice that reflects the real game, and skills that enable you to access physical, mental, and emotional states that lead to better play. But we believe the place you can really improve your game is on the golf course, so in this book, we&#x2019;ll teach you what we call &#x201c;human skills,&#x201d; which you&#x2019;ll rely on in the actual context of the game. As you learn these skills, you will learn more about yourself. You will be able to rely on yourself. You will be able to adjust. You will become your own best coach. Which means, you&#x2019;ll be a player.<br> <br>In our opinion, there are four pillars that support a golfer&#x2019;s game: 1) your fitness level, 2) your technical skills (that is, your swing and stroke), 3) your equipment, and 4) your human skills. Unfortunately, the human skills are rarely taught&#x2014;and to us, these are essential to playing good golf.<br> <br>We look at it this way: Once you step onto the golf course, can you change your fitness level, your technical skills, or your equipment? No. The only one of these pillars you have control over on the course is your human skills. Developing these skills&#x2014;especially self-awareness and self-management&#x2014;will help you play your best. Human skills will also help you manage emotions that invariably arise on the course, such as anxiety, frustration, fear, discouragement, and anger. They can also help you create positive states such as focus, confidence, equanimity, courage, and joy&#x2014;all of which help you enjoy the game more.<br> <br>During our collective 64 years of teaching and coaching, we&#x2019;ve become super-interested in the conditions that facilitate peak performance&#x2014;that is, when people are performing at the highest level of their abilities. Whether the performers are dancers, musicians, surgeons, or golfers, one common denominator is that, in the moment of performance, they are fully present through their senses&#x2014;particularly sight, sound, and feel. When this happens, we are capable of far more than we&#x2019;ve ever imagined.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s why we named our company VISION54. We wanted to invoke a new frontier, the idea that a golfer will shoot a score of 54 someday. That could mean making birdies on all 18 holes, or a combination of pars, birdies, and eagles. 54 is a number. It&#x2019;s also a philosophy oriented toward possibilities rather than limitations. 54 is a process of changing old habits and learning new ones. It&#x2019;s a discipline of managing your physical, mental, and emotional states on a golf course&#x2014;in an environment that&#x2019;s always changing.<br> <br>We have full confidence that a golfer will shoot 54 someday soon: To date, fewer than 20 players have carded a 59 in competition. One of the 59-shooters, Annika Sorenstam, was coached by Pia. Another, Russell Knox, is a PGA Tour professional we currently coach. (By the way, we append the number 54 to the names of all players we coach: Russell Knox is &#x201c;Roo54.&#x201d; He gets his nickname, Roo, because he carries a kangaroo headcover. PGA Tour winner Kevin Streelman is &#x201c;Streels54,&#x201d; and another of our students, Condoleezza Rice, is &#x201c;Condi54.&#x201d;) So, what will it take to open the door to the next performance breakthrough in golf? In our opinion, shooting 54 will require a paradigm shift from a &#x201c;faults-and-fixes&#x201d; approach to a &#x201c;possibilities-and-excellence&#x201d; approach that will additionally rely on human skills.<br> <br>We think of this as a back-to-the-future concept. When the Society of St. Andrews Golfers was founded in 1754, there were no professional instructors, no practice ranges, and no swing simulators. Golfers learned to play on the course, in the context of the game. They figured out how to properly flight a shot, manage their nerves, and focus on the parts of the game they could control. Throughout history, great champions have embodied these skills: Old Tom Morris, Joyce Wethered, Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan, Kathy Whitworth, Arnold Palmer, Nancy Lopez, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, and Annika Sorenstam used their human skills to become great players of the game. It&#x2019;s our opinion that these skills don&#x2019;t have to remain implicit, or mysterious, or the province of champions. Today, thanks to advances in science and performance research, and our years of observing and coaching golfers, we can help make implicit skills explicit.<br> <br>In the following chapters, you&#x2019;ll learn these human skills on the course alongside some of our professional and amateur students: current and former LPGA Tour players Suzann Pettersen, Brittany Lang, Ariya Jutanugarn, and Annika Sorenstam; current and former PGA Tour players Russell Knox, Kevin Streelman, and Arron Oberholser; amateurs such as Condoleezza Rice and A.K. Frazier and Amy Lane, to name a few. These players acquired human skills that enabled them to play to their full potential.<br> <br>Recent research in fields such as psychophysiology, neuroscience, and athletic training have changed the way we think about how we learn, what our true capacities are, and what creates peak performance. These fields incorporate medicine, psychology, physiology, brain science, nutrition, biofeedback, contextual learning, and meditation. They propose that we have a capacity to learn and perform at a higher level than most had ever imagined, enabling us to bridge the long-assumed mind/body divide. This allows us to consider golf in a new light, because it points directly to us; we are capable of more improvement, growth, and self-regulation than we thought possible. However, the work of crossing this mind/body divide, and attaining these larger goals, is up to each of us.<br> <br>We&#x2019;re not alone in discovering a new, forward-thinking philosophy. Many of our peers in golf and other sports are just as committed to these new ideas. In this book, we want to introduce some of the people and concepts that have influenced us over the years&#x2014;innovative teachers like Chuck Hogan and Kjell Enhager; human-potential thinkers such as Michael Murphy and Ken Wilber; scientists and psychologists the likes of JoAnne Whitaker and Carol Dweck; techniques like HeartMath, and even an approach to communication and personal growth called Neuro-Linguistic Programming. We&#x2019;ve studied these disciplines, extracted the best ideas, and incorporated them into our VISION...</p><h2>The Bible from 30,000 Feet: Soaring Through the Scriptures in One Year from Genesis to Revelation</h2><p><p> "The perfect book to help you keep your eyes and your Bible wide open!"<br> &#x2014;<strong>David Jeremiah</strong>, Pastor and bestselling author<br> &nbsp; </p> <p> <strong>An Eye-Opening and Engaging Guide to the Bible</strong> </p> <p> Enjoy the magnificent panorama of Scripture like never before!

My hands shake from exhaustion, fear, and sorrow as I unlatch the lock to the door of my residence hall rooms and turn the handle. I let out a sigh of relief as I see Raffe Jeffries in the doorway. Though we share the same path of study, there is little else that is similar about us. Me from the colonies, who had to survive The Testing to be here. He from Tosu City, where students related to former graduates are welcomed into the University with open arms. We are not friends. Even after he helped save my life last night, I do not know if I can trust him. But I have no choice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raffe appears unconcerned, but I can read the warning in his eyes as he steps into my sitting room and closes the door behind him. &#x201c;Cia, they know.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My knees weaken, and I grip the back of a chair for support. &#x201c;Know what?&#x201d; That I left campus? That I know the rebellion led by the man who helped me during The Testing isn&#x2019;t what the rebels believe? That soon the rebels will launch an attack that will lead them to their deaths? That Damone . . . I push my thoughts away from that question.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Professor Holt knows we both left campus.&#x201d; His dark eyes meet mine. &#x201c;And Griffin has started looking for Damone.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course Griffin would be looking for his friend. When he doesn&#x2019;t find him, he will alert the head of our residence, Professor Holt. She will wonder why the Tosu City Government Studies student has vanished. Will Dr. Barnes and his officials believe the pressure to succeed has caused Damone to flee? Or will they launch a search for him and discover that he&#x2019;s dead? Panic begins to swell. I tell myself there wasn&#x2019;t another option. But was there?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shake my head. Unless I want my future to contain Redirection or worse, I have to avoid thinking about what is past.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no rules that say we cannot leave campus. I cannot be punished for that alone. But if they know what I have seen . . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take a steadying breath, then ask, &#x201c;Does Professor Holt know when we left or if we left together?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fingers trace the lightning bolt symbol on the silver and gold bracelet encircling my wrist as I think of the tracking device contained inside. The one I thought I had beaten. Only, I was wrong. I was wrong about everything. Now Michal is dead and . . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think anyone knows how long we were gone. No one saw us leave, and I don&#x2019;t think anyone spotted us when we returned to campus.&#x201d; Raffe runs a hand through his dark hair. &#x201c;But Griffin stopped me when I was going to deliver your message to Tomas. He asked if I had seen Damone. Then he&nbsp; wanted to know where you and I went this morning. I don&#x2019;t know how, but he knew we were together.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not told Raffe about the tracking device in his bracelet. Part of me had hoped I would not need to share my secrets. My father warned me before I came to Tosu City for The Testing to trust no one. But I have. I must again now. Because he&#x2019;s helped me, Raffe is in danger.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, I tell Raffe about what&#x2019;s hidden inside the bracelets and about the transmitter Tomas and I designed to block the signal and hide our movements from Dr. Barnes. Only, sometime last night or this morning, that transmitter fell out of my pocket. Where and when it was lost I do not know.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raffe looks down at the symbol etched on his bracelet&#x2015;a coiled spring in the center of the balanced scales of justice. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re monitoring our movements.&#x201d; There is no surprise. No outrage. Only a nod of the head before he says, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to have to find a better way to block the signal if we don&#x2019;t want them watching our every move when we do whatever you have planned next.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have planned . . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week President Collindar will stand in the United Commonwealth Government&#x2019;s Debate Chamber and ask the members to vote on a new proposal. One that&#x2015;if approved&#x2015;will shift administration of The Testing and the University from Dr. Barnes&#x2019;s autonomous control. One that will force him to report to the president and allow her to end the practices that have killed so many who wanted nothing more than to help their colonies and their country. But while I&#x2019;d like to believe the proposal will pass and The Testing will come to an end, everything I have learned tells me it is doomed to fail. When it does, rumor says Dr. Barnes&#x2019;s supporters will call for a vote of confidence on the president. A vote that&#x2015;if lost by the president&#x2015;will signal not only the end of her role as leader, but the start of a battle that the rebels and the president have no hope of winning, since Dr. Barnes knows of their plans. Indeed, he and his supporter Symon Dean have planned the rebellion itself. Only recently have I learned its true purpose, which is to identify, occupy, and ultimately destroy any who would oppose the selection methods of The Testing. The time is fast approaching when Dr. Barnes will allow his people among the rebels to escalate their outrage and encourage open warfare, in order to crush that rebellion with violence of his own. If Dr. Barnes&#x2019;s plan succeeds, those who seek to end The Testing will die&#x2015;and my brother will be among them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&#x2019;t sit back and allow that to happen, but I don&#x2019;t know how I can help stop the events that are already spinning into motion. I thought I knew. I thought I had found a way to help. But I only made things worse. Now Dr. Barnes will be watching my movements even more closely than before. I wish there were time to think things through. My brothers always teased that it took me hours to make a decision that took others minutes, yet my father taught me that anything important deserves thoughtful study. The choices that face me now are the most important of my life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I scared? Yes. As the youngest student at the University, I find it hard to believe that my actions could change the course of my country&#x2019;s history. That I am clever enough to outthink Dr. Barnes and his officials and save lives. But there is no other way. The odds favor my failure, but I still have to try.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Right now the only thing I have planned is to do my homework and get some sleep.&#x201d; When Raffe starts to protest, I say, &#x201c;You need sleep, too.&#x201d; The way his shoulders sag tells me he is just as tired as I. &#x201c;Maybe if we&#x2019;re rested we&#x2019;ll come up with a way to help stop what&#x2019;s coming.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raffe nods. &#x201c;Regardless, with everything that&#x2019;s happened, it&#x2019;s probably best we stay inside the residence for the rest of the day. I&#x2019;m sure Professor Holt will have someone watching you. You&#x2019;ll need to be careful.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A muffled series of clicks catches my attention. There it is again. One. Two. Three faint clicks of the transmission button on the Transit Communicator. The signal Zeen suggested we use to indicate one of us needs to talk. He must have found a place where it is safe for him to speak. But it is not safe for me. Not with Raffe here. I have been forced into trusting him with many things, but I will not trust him with this. Not with my brother&#x2019;s life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you later today,&#x201d; I say. Raffe cocks his head to the side. His eyes narrow as the three clicks come again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretending I hear nothing, I walk to the door and open it. &#x201c;I have an assignment I have to get to work on.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raffe looks around the small sitting room. My heart beats off the seconds as he waits for the clicking noise to recur. When it doesn&#x2019;t, he shakes his head and walks to the door. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be around if you need anything.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door swings shut, I flip the lock and hurry to my bedroom. My fingers slide under the edge of the mattress and close around the device I brought with me from Five Lakes Colony. It was designed to communicate across distances of less than twenty miles with a device my father kept in his office. The one Zeen must hold now while waiting for me to respond.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I click the communication button three times to indicate I have received his signal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Cia. I can&#x2019;t tell you how glad I am Michal finally told you where I am. I wanted to contact you the minute I got to Tosu City, but Michal said it would be best to wait. Are you okay?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of Zeen&#x2019;s voice fills me with warmth. Growing up, I could always tell Zeen anything. Of all my brothers, he was the one I went to when I needed help with a problem. I was certain he could come up with the answer for everything. I hope that is still true.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; For now. &#x201c;But&#x2015;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; I hear Zeen sigh. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s good. Cia, I&#x2019;m sorry I was so angry. I shouldn&#x2019;t have let you leave without saying goodbye. I was jealous because you got what I thought I wanted. I didn&#x2019;t know . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think about the hurt I felt when Zeen disappeared before I left for The Testing. Of all of us, he is the most passionate. The easiest to upset. The quickest to react when his emotions are stirred and hardest hit when those he loves are wounded or taken away. Which is why I understood his absence when my family said their farewells and why I can honestly say, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. Besides, if you hadn&#x2019;t stormed off, I would have asked permission to take this Communicator and you would have turned me down. I wouldn&#x2019;t have made it through the last couple of months without it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You should have heard me yell when I saw your note.&#x201d; Zeen laughs. &#x201c;Mom said it was a small price to pay for how I&#x2019;d behaved, since I might never see you again. She didn&#x2019;t want me to come, but Dad understood why I had to. Cia, there are things happening here. Important things. I don&#x2019;t know if Michal told you, but these people are going to end The Testing. The leaders here have a plan that will change everything. It&#x2019;s dangerous.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Zeen . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Zeen isn&#x2019;t listening. When I was little, Zeen used to talk to me for hours about things I didn&#x2019;t understand, but I didn&#x2019;t care. I loved listening to his voice and knowing that he understood the things he talked about. But he doesn&#x2019;t understand now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Zeen . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;And it&#x2019;s complicated and will take too long for me to explain. I can&#x2019;t talk for much longer or someone will come searching for me. With everything going on, they&#x2019;re slow to trust. Even with Michal&#x2019;s endorsement. I think they would have arrested me the minute I walked into camp if it weren&#x2019;t for&#x2015;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Zeen, stop!&#x201d; When there is silence, I say, &#x201c;Michal&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d; My throat tightens. Tears prick the backs of my eyes. Saying the words aloud makes them all too real. &#x201c;I saw him die.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Cia, that can&#x2019;t be true.&#x201d; But the hitch in Zeen&#x2019;s voice tells me he is shaken by my words. &#x201c;I would have heard if Michal died. Symon or Ranetta would have told us.&#x201d; Zeen&#x2019;s soothing tone is the same one he used when I was small and thought there were monsters lurking under the bed. Only there is no soothing me with kind words now. I know these monsters are real.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Symon wouldn&#x2019;t have told you because he&#x2019;s the one who killed Michal.&#x201d; I look at the clock beside my bed. Five minutes have passed. If Zeen is right, people will soon come searching for him. I don&#x2019;t want them to hear him talking into the Communicator and think he&#x2019;s a spy. There is so much to say. So little time to say it in. I have to decide what is important now and what can wait until we can arrange another time to speak.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Michal brought Symon the proof the president needs to sway the Debate Chamber vote and end The Testing in a peaceful way. I was hiding nearby.&#x201d; I can still see the way the rebellion leader looked when he raised his gun and fired. Two shots. Then Michal fell to the ground. &#x201c;I heard Symon say that he and Dr. Barnes created the rebellion to control those who want to bring an end to The Testing. The rebellion isn&#x2019;t real.&#x201d;</p><h2>From Here to There: A Book of Mazes to Wander and Explore (Maze Books for Kids, Maze Games, Maze Puzzle Book)</h2><p>Sean Jackson has been illustrating and exploring mazes for his own enjoyment for more than 30 years.

In the morning and late afternoon, tea shops fill with workers downing their first cup of tea brewed the color of burnt caramel and lightened with condensed and evaporated milks. For lunch at a popular restaurant like Feel, customers point at dishes set out on the counter and then sit down and wait as servers bring small plates to the table in rapid-fire fashion. To escape the afternoon heat, locals pop into shops serving sweetened yogurt drinks or a &#x201c;heart cooler&#x201d;&#x2014;coconut milk served over agar jelly, tapioca pearls, and ice. Before dinner, people line up in front of vendors frying up the Burmese answer to tempura. Like the rest of the country, the city grows quiet at night, with the exception of 19th Street, which turns into an open-air market where you can pick and choose from stalls offering skewers of whole fish, squid, pork intestine, or mushrooms. Pitchers of Myanmar beer tide over groups of customers while the stalls grill selections.<br><br>Eating in Yangon means sampling a range of culinary traditions, from regional ethnic foods to dishes adapted from neighboring countries, especially China and India. No matter which heritage hits the table, one thing is certain: it&#x2019;s easy to find a dish&#x2014;or several&#x2014;that you can&#x2019;t wait to eat again.<br><b>GARLIC NOODLES</b><br><br>Some form of this comfort dish is made in nearly every corner of Asia, and it has long been a popular item both in Myanmar and at Burma Superstar. While the noodles, which get their flavor from fried garlic and garlic-infused oil, are respectable on their own, some like to beef up the dish with shredded duck, barbecue pork, saut�ed shrimp, or stir-fried mushrooms and broccoli. Anything goes. The trickiest part of making garlic noodles is ensuring the garlic doesn&#x2019;t burn. In this recipe, the garlic is pulled off the heat and left to cool in the oil. If you want to safeguard the process a bit more, set up a heat-proof bowl with a mesh strainer. When the garlic reaches a deep golden color, pour the garlic through the strainer to stop the cooking.&nbsp;<br><b><br>SERVES 4</b><br> <b>1&#x2044;4 cup canola oil</b><br> <b>4 tablespoons minced garlic</b><br> <b>3&#x2044;4 cup sliced red onion or shallot, soaked in water and drained</b><br> <b>2 tablespoons soy sauce</b><br> <b>1&#x2044;2 cup sriracha</b><br> <b>1 tablespoon minced ginger</b><br> <b>1&#x2044;4 teaspoon sugar</b><br> <b>1&#x2044;4 teaspoon salt</b><br> <b>2 tablespoons water</b><br> <b>12 ounces fresh wide wonton noodles or dried Chinese wheat noodles</b><br> <b>1 (5-inch) cucumber (or half an English cucumber), thinly sliced</b><br> <b>3 green onions (white and green parts), thinly sliced<br></b><br>In a small pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons of the garlic, set the heat to low, and fry, swirling the pot frequently, until the garlic is nearly golden in color, no more than 3 minutes. (If the garlic starts to darken too quickly, pull the pot off the heat, swirl the oil, and let the garlic continue to fry off the heat for 30 seconds before returning it to the heat.) Because the garlic can burn quickly, watch the pot the whole time while the garlic fries.<br><br> Immediately pour the oil into a heatproof bowl and let it cool. The garlic will continue to cook and turn golden as it sits. If the garlic is already golden brown before you take it off the heat and it looks like it might burn if left in the hot oil, all is not lost. Pour the oil through a fine-mesh strainer into a heatproof bowl to remove the garlic from the oil and stop it from cooking further. Once the oil has cooled a bit, return the garlic to the oil.<br><br> Add the onions and soy sauce to garlic.<br><br> In a small serving bowl, stir together the sriracha, the remaining 1 tablespoon of garlic, the ginger, sugar, salt, and water.<br><br> Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook, stirring often with chopsticks, until nearly soft all the way through, about 4 minutes or until tender but still slightly chewy. Drain in a colander and rinse briefly under cool running water. Give the colander a shake to remove excess water.<br><br> Return the noodles to the pot. Pour in the garlic&#x2013;soy sauce mixture and add the cucumbers. Give the noodles a good stir with a pair of tongs, then divide among bowls. Top with the green onions. Serve with sriracha sauce.</p><h2>Snoopy: Cowabunga!: A PEANUTS Collection (Volume 1) (Peanuts Kids)</h2><p>What began in the funny pages in 1950 has developed into an enduring classic. Whether you're a fussbudget like Lucy, philosopher like Linus, Flying Ace like Snoopy, or a lovable loser like Charlie Brown, there is something to touch your heart or make you laugh in <i>Peanuts.</i><br><br>Charles Schulz&#x2019;s <i>Peanuts</i> is one of the most timeless and beloved comic strips ever. Now AMP! helps carry on that legacy with new collections of <i>Peanuts</i> classics focused around topics sure to resonate with middle-grade readers. Kicking off the series is <i>Snoopy: Cowabunga!</i> <br><br>First published in 1950, the classic <i>Peanuts</i> strip now appears in more than 2,200 newspapers in 75 countries in 25 languages. Phrases such as &#x201c;security blanket&#x201d; and &#x201c;good grief,&#x201d; which originated in the <i>Peanuts </i>world, are now part of the global vernacular, and images of Charles Schulz&#x2019;s classic characters&#x2014; Charlie Brown kicking the football, Lucy leaning over Schroeder&#x2019;s piano&#x2014;are now universally recognized.<br><br>Together these books will introduce a new generation of kids to the lovable cast in time for the new animated <i>Peanuts</i> movie, which hits theaters in 2015!</p><p>Charles Schulz is a legend. He was the hand and heart behind 50 years of Peanuts, which featured one of the world&#39;s most beloved and recognizable cast of cartoon characters, until his death in 2000.When the Peanuts newspaper strip began its five-decade run, in 1950, good ol&#x2019; Charlie Brown was the undisputed focus. But gradually, as his beagle, Snoopy, grew more anthropomorphic and his humanlike thoughts became verbalized in balloons, the insouciant canine became the strip&#x2019;s most popular character. In this collection, he plays tennis and football, hands out colored eggs as the Easter Beagle, appears as the WWI Flying Ace and BMOC Joe Cool, performs puppet-theater productions for the neighborhood gang, receives countless rejection slips as a frustrated author, and hangs out with his feathered friend Woodstock&#x2014;all beguilingly depicted in Schulz&#x2019;s simple, subtle, and sublime drawings. The original black-and-white daily strips benefit from the tasteful addition of color in this volume for kids. If Charlie Brown, with his worries and insecurities, was the character readers were most likely to relate to (and the one who reflected creator Schulz&#x2019;s own neuroses), Snoopy&#x2019;s joie de vivre and rich fantasy life make him the perfect aspirational figure for younger readers.

Washington?</h2><p><b>Learn how a slave became one of the leading influential African American intellectuals of the late 19th century.</b><br><br>African American educator, author, speaker, and advisor to presidents of the United States, Booker Taliaferro Washington was the leading voice of former slaves and their descendants during the late 1800s. As part of the last generation of leaders born into slavery, Booker believed that blacks could better progress in society through education and entrepreneurship, rather than trying to directly challenge the Jim Crow segregation. After hearing the Emancipation Proclamation and realizing he was free, young Booker decided to make learning his life. He taught himself to read and write, pursued a formal education, and went on to found the Tuskegee Institute--a black school in Alabama--with the goal of building the community's economic strength and pride. The institute still exists and is home to famous alumnae like scientist George Washington Carver.</p><p>James Buckley Jr. has written more than 50 books for kids, including <i>Who Was Ernest Shackleton?</i> and <i>Who Was Roberto Clemente?</i><b>Who Was Booker T. Washington?<br></b><br> &nbsp;<br> Booker T. Washington was born a slave in the Southern state of Virginia in 1856. He was one of millions of people of African descent forced to work in the fields of large farms, called plantations, without pay. They were considered property by white people who called themselves masters.<br> &nbsp;<br> White children lived in and near the plantation, too. They were the sons and daughters of the masters and paid white workers. They studied together in a schoolhouse. As a young boy, Booker walked by the school building many times. He knew something amazing was happening inside, and he wanted very badly to be a part of it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes, he would be told to carry the books of one of the plantation master&#x2019;s daughters. He would walk her to the door of the schoolhouse, but no farther. He peered inside before the door closed in his face. He later wrote that &#x201c;the picture of several dozen boys and girls engaged in study made a deep impression upon me, and I had the feeling that to get into a schoolhouse and study in this way would be about the same as getting into paradise.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Booker dreamed about the world of books, reading, and education. But it was a risky dream.<br> &nbsp;<br> Enslaved children were not allowed to go to school. It was even illegal for a slave to learn to read! One of the main reasons white owners didn&#x2019;t want slaves to be educated was so that they would not find out about the world outside their plantation.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;From the moment that [I was told] that it was dangerous for me to learn to read&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I resolved that I should never be satisfied until I learned what this dangerous practice was like.&#x201d; Booker knew that if he was caught with a book, he might be whipped as punishment.<br> &nbsp;<br> But still he dreamed. And Booker made learning his life. He studied hard and eventually became a teacher. He helped thousands of African Americans and former slaves get an education. He also inspired the creation of dozens of schools and universities for black people.<br> &nbsp;<br> Booker worked his whole life to give others the chance at learning that he had struggled to get. His devotion to education for African Americans made him famous around the world. He showed that with focus and determination, a person could come &#x201c;up from slavery&#x201d; to a better life.<br> &nbsp;<br><b><br>Chapter 1:&nbsp;A Difficult Beginning</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Booker T. Washington was born on a farm in Virginia on April 5, 1856, he did not have a last name. He was just called Booker. He was born a slave. Booker&#x2019;s mother, Jane, was also a slave. She cooked for everyone on the farm. Booker&#x2019;s older brother, John, was a slave, too. &#x201c;Who my father was, I have never been able to learn with any degree of certainty,&#x201d; Booker wrote.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dozens of other slaves lived and worked on the farm. They were forced to do whatever work their masters&#x2014;the bosses on the farm&#x2014;told them to do. They weren&#x2019;t paid for their labor. All the slaves were owned by Mr. Burroughs. They had no rights of their own.<br> &nbsp;<br> The slaves on the Burroughs farm were not alone. Throughout the Southern United States, millions of black people were enslaved. For more than one hundred years, they had been kidnapped and taken from Africa to the United States and islands throughout the Caribbean. Slaves were considered property, the same as a horse for riding or a plow to use in the fields.<br> &nbsp;<br> Families were broken up and sold to other plantations. Children could be taken from their mothers and sold, too. If a slave ever dared to disobey his master, he could be punished by whipping or worse.<br> &nbsp;<br> About his early life as a slave, Booker later wrote that it &#x201c;had its beginning in the midst of the most miserable, desolate, and discouraging surrounding.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Booker&#x2019;s home was a small shack. The floor was dirt and there were no windows&#x2014;just the openings where windows should have been. The door was a thin plank of wood that did not shut completely. Cold wind blew in during the winter, and dust blew through in the summer. The children in Booker&#x2019;s family slept on a pile of rags on the floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first pair of shoes Booker wore had soles made of wood and were very uncomfortable. His clothes were made from a rough and scratchy fabric called flax. Booker said that putting on his new flax shirt was &#x201c;torture.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jane was very busy cooking all day long and could not spend much time with her sons. Booker later wrote that his family never sat down to a meal together. He said that the children got their meals &#x201c;much as the dumb animals [got] theirs.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Most of the family&#x2019;s shack was taken up with the cooking fire and pots and pans, leaving only a tiny space for Jane and her children. The center of the floor was dug into a pit where potatoes were stored.<br> &nbsp;<br> Booker worked in the fields and around his home, helping Jane. He had no winter clothes. When he was sick, his mother took care of him. There were no doctors for slaves. In 1861, when Booker was about five, he was included on a list that showed the value of the Burroughs slaves as property. It read: &#x201c;1 Negro Boy (Booker)&#x2014;$400.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The life of a slave was one of constant work. The white people who owned slaves did not let their &#x201c;property&#x201d; learn to read or go to school, or even hope for a better future. The plantation masters saw no value in educating slaves. But not everyone in America believed that owning slaves was right.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Civil War, which began in 1861, was fought for several reasons, but the biggest was slavery. Most Northern states were against slavery. Most Southern states were for it. The Southern plantations relied on slaves to do the difficult field work for free. That meant more profit for the landowners. Many Southerners believed that black people were simply not human. The Southern states did not want to be told what to do by Northern states that did not rely on farming as much.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Civil War battles raged throughout the South and even into some Northern states, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.<br> &nbsp;<br> For two years after President Lincoln&#x2019;s proclamation, the war continued. Booker, along with nearly four million other people, remained enslaved. The Civil War became the deadliest in the nation&#x2019;s history. More than 620,000 American soldiers were killed. In April 1865, the Union Army of the North won the Civil War. Lincoln&#x2019;s proclamation could now be enforced in the South.<br> &nbsp;<br> Booker remembered the day a Union Army officer visited the Burroughs farm. The officer gathered the slaves together and read the Proclamation. Jane, Booker, and their family realized with amazement that they were no longer slaves.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There was great rejoicing, and thanksgiving,&#x201d; Booker later wrote. At the time, he was nine years old. And he was free.</p><h2>More Money Than God: Hedge Funds and the Making of a New Elite (Council on Foreign Relations Books (Penguin Press))</h2><p><b>"Splendid...the definitive history of the hedge fund, a compelling narrative full of larger-than-life characters and dramatic tales." &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i> </b> <br><br> Wealthy, powerful, and potentially dangerous, hedge fund moguls have become the It Boys of twenty-first- century capitalism. Beating the market was long thought to be impossible, but hedge funds cracked its mysteries and made fortunes in the process. Drawing on his unprecedented access to the industry, esteemed financial writer Sebastian Mallaby tells the inside story of the hedge funds, from their origins in the 1960s to their role in the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009.<br><br>Read Sebastian Mallaby's new book,&nbsp;<i>The Man Who Knew: The Life and Times of Alan Greenspan</i>.</p><p><strong>Sebastian Mallaby on Hedge Funds</strong> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> I set out to write the history of hedge funds for two reasons. Explaining the most secretive subculture of our economy posed an irresistible investigative challenge; and the common view of hedge funds seemed ripe for correction. Hedge funds were generally regarded as the least stable part of the financial system. Yet they managed risk better than banks, investment banks, insurers, and so on&#x2014;and they did so without a safety net from taxpayers. </p> <p> Four years on, the book is done; and both my original motivations have been vindicated. Unearthing the story of hedge funds has been pure fun: From the left-wing anti-Nazi activist , A. W. Jones, to the irrepressible cryptographer, Jim Simons, the story of hedge funds is packed full of larger than life characters. Getting my hands on internal documents from George Soros&#x2019;s Quantum Fund; visiting Paul Tudor Jones and reading the eureka emails he wrote in the middle of the night; poring over the entire set of monthly letters that the Julian Robertson wrote during the twenty year life of his Tiger fund; interviewing Stan Druckenmiller, Louis Bacon, and hundreds of other industry participants: my research has yielded a wealth of investment insights, as well as an understanding of why governments frequently collide markets. Meanwhile, the financial crisis of 2007-2009 vindicated my hypothesis that hedge funds are the good guys in finance. They came through the turmoil relatively unscathed, and never took a cent of taxpayers&#x2019; money. </p> <p> Since the book has come out, many readers have posed the skeptical question: Do hedge funds really make money systematically? The answer is an emphatic yes; and without giving the whole book away, I can point to a couple of reasons why hedge funds do outsmart the supposedly efficient market. </p> <p> First, hedge funds often trade against people who are buying or selling for some reason other than profit. In the currency markets, for example, hedge funders such as Bruce Kovner might trade against a central bank that is buying its own currency because it has a political mandate to prop it up. In the credit markets, likewise, a hedge fund such as Farallon might trade against pension funds whose rules require them to sell bonds of companies in bankruptcy. It&#x2019;s not surprising that hedge funds beat the market when they trade against governments and buy bonds from forced sellers. </p> <p>Second, the hedge-fund structure makes people compete harder. There is an incentive to manage the downside: hedge-fund managers have their own money in their funds, so they lose personally if they take losses. There is an incentive to seek out the upside: hedge-fund managers keep a fifth of their funds&#x2019; profits. This combination explains why hedge funds were up in 2007, when most other investors were losing their shirts; it explains why they were down in 2008 by only half as much as the S&amp;P 500 index. People sometimes suggest that hedge funds survived the subprime bubble by fluke&#x2014;perhaps their ranks include wacky misfits who are naturally contrarian. But there is more to it than that. John Paulson poured $2 million in the research that gave him the conviction to bet against the bubble. The hedge-fund structure created the incentive to make that investment. </p> <p>Financial risk is not going away. Currencies and interest rates will rise and fall; there will be difficult decisions about how to allocated scarce capital in a sophisticated and specialized economy. The question is who will manage this risk without demanding a taxpayer backstop. The answer is hiding in plain sight: To a surprising and unrecognized degree, the future of finance lies in the history of hedge funds. </p> <i>--Sebastian Mallaby</i> <p></p> (Photo of Sebastian Mallaby � Julia Ewan)Sebastian Mallaby&nbsp;is the author of several books, including <i>More Money Than God </i>and <i>The Man Who Knew: The Life and Times of Alan Greenspan</i>.

This Russian doll of a novel, a story within a story within a story, visits Roland and his <i>ka-tet</i> as a ferocious, frigid storm halts their progress along the Path of the Beam. Roland tells a tale from his early days as a gunslinger, in the guilt-ridden year following his mother&#x2019;s death. Sent by his father to investigate evidence of a murderous shape-shifter, Roland takes charge of Bill Streeter, a brave but terrified boy who is the sole surviving witness to the beast&#x2019;s most recent slaughter. Roland, himself only a teenager, calms the boy by reciting a story from the <i>Book of Eld</i> that his mother used to read to him at bedtime, &#x201c;The Wind through the Keyhole.&#x201d; &#x201c;A person&#x2019;s never too old for stories,&#x201d; he says to Bill. &#x201c;Man and boy, girl and woman, we live for them.&#x201d;<br> <br>And stories like <i>The Wind Through the Keyhole</i> live for us with Stephen King&#x2019;s fantastical magic that &#x201c;creates the kind of fully imagined fictional landscapes a reader can inhabit for days at a stretch&#x201d; (<i>The Washington Post</i>).</p><p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series). His novel&nbsp;<i>11/22/63</i>&nbsp;was named a&nbsp;top ten book of 2011 by&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;Book Review</i>&nbsp;and won the&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Times</i>&nbsp;Book Prize for Mystery/Thriller. His epic works&nbsp;<i>The Dark Tower</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>It</i>&nbsp;are the basis for&nbsp;major motion pictures, with&nbsp;<i>It&nbsp;</i>now the highest grossing horror film of all time. He is the recipient&nbsp;of the 2018 PEN America Literary Service Award, the&nbsp;2014 National Medal of Arts, and the&nbsp;2003 National Book Foundation Medal for&nbsp;Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.&nbsp;He lives in Bangor, Maine, with his wife,&nbsp;novelist Tabitha King.An excerpt from <i>The Wind through the Keyhole: A Dark Tower Novel </i>by Stephen King<p>&nbsp;</p><p>FOREWORD</p><p>Most of the people holding this book have followed the adventures of Roland and his band&#x2014;his ka-tet&#x2014;for years, some of them from the very beginning. Others&#x2014;and I hope there are many, newcomers and Constant Readers alike&#x2014;may ask, <i>Can I read and enjoy this</i> <i>story if I haven&#x2019;t read the other Dark Tower books? </i>My answer is yes, if you keep a few things in mind. </p><p>First, Mid-World lies next to our world, and there are many overlaps. In some places there are doorways between the two worlds, and sometimes there are thin places, porous places, where the two worlds actually mingle. Three of Roland&#x2019;s ka-tet&#x2014;Eddie, Susannah, and Jake have been drawn separately from troubled lives in New York into Roland&#x2019;s Mid-World quest. Their fourth traveling companion, a billy-bumbler named Oy, is a golden-eyed creature native to Mid-World. Mid-World is very old, and falling to ruin, filled with monsters and untrustworthy magic. </p><p>Second, Roland Deschain of Gilead is a gunslinger&#x2014;one of a small band that tries to keep order in an increasingly lawless world. If you think of the gunslingers of Gilead as a strange combination of knights errant and territorial marshals in the Old West, you&#x2019;ll be close to the mark. Most of them, although not all, are descended from the line of the old White King, known as Arthur Eld (I told you there were overlaps).</p><p>Third, Roland has lived his life under a terrible curse. He killed his mother, who was having an affair&#x2014;mostly against her will, and certainly against her better judgment&#x2014;with a fellow you will meet in these pages. Although it was by mistake, he holds himself accountable, and the unhappy Gabrielle Deschain&#x2019;s death has haunted him since his young manhood. These events are fully narrated in the Dark Tower cycle, but for our purposes here, I think it&#x2019;s all you have to know. </p><p>For longtime readers, this book should be shelved between <i>Wizard</i> <i>and Glass </i>and <i>Wolves of the Calla </i>. . . which makes it, I suppose, <i>Dark Tower 4.5.</i></p><p>As for me, I was delighted to discover my old friends had a little more to say. It was a great gift to find them again, years after I thought their stories were told.</p><p>&#x2014;Stephen King</p><p>September 14, 2011</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>STARKBLAST</p><p>During the days after they left the Green Palace that wasn&#x2019;t Oz after all&#x2014;but which was now the tomb of the unpleasant fellow Roland&#x2019;s ka-tet had known as the Tick-Tock Man&#x2014;the boy Jake began to range farther and farther ahead of Roland, Eddie, and Susannah.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you worry about him?&#x201d; Susannah asked Roland. &#x201c;Out there on his own?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got Oy with him,&#x201d; Eddie said, referring to the billy-bumbler who had adopted Jake as his special friend. &#x201c;Mr. Oy gets along with nice folks all right, but he&#x2019;s got a mouthful of sharp teeth for those who aren&#x2019;t so nice. As that guy Gasher found out to his sorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jake also has his father&#x2019;s gun,&#x201d; Roland said. &#x201c;And he knows how to use it. That he knows very well. And he won&#x2019;t leave the Path of the Beam.&#x201d; He pointed overhead with his reduced hand. The lowhanging sky was mostly still, but a single corridor of clouds moved</p><p>steadily southeast. Toward the land of Thunderclap, if the note left behind for them by the man who styled himself RF had told the truth.</p><p>Toward the Dark Tower.</p><p>&#x201c;But why&#x2014;&#x201d; Susannah began, and then her wheelchair hit a bump. She turned to Eddie. &#x201c;Watch where you&#x2019;re pushin me, sugar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Eddie said. &#x201c;Public Works hasn&#x2019;t been doing any maintenance along this stretch of the turnpike lately. Must be dealing with budget cuts.&#x201d;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t a turnpike, but it <i>was </i>a road . . . or had been: two ghostly ruts with an occasional tumbledown shack to mark the way. Earlier that morning they had even passed an abandoned store with a barely readable sign: TOOK&#x2019;S OUTLAND MERCANTILE. They investigated inside for supplies&#x2014;Jake and Oy had still been with them then&#x2014;and had found nothing but dust, ancient cobwebs, and the skeleton of what had been either a large raccoon, a small dog, or a billy-bumbler. Oy had taken a cursory sniff and then pissed on the bones before leaving the store to sit on the hump in the middle of the old road with his squiggle of a tail curled around him. He faced back the way they had come, sniffing the air. </p><p>Roland had seen the bumbler do this several times lately, and although he had said nothing, he pondered it. Someone trailing them, maybe? He didn&#x2019;t actually believe this, but the bumbler&#x2019;s posture&#x2014;nose lifted, ears pricked, tail curled&#x2014;called up some old memory or association that he couldn&#x2019;t quite catch.</p><p>&#x201c;Why does Jake want to be on his own?&#x201d; Susannah asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you find it worrisome, Susannah of New York?&#x201d; Roland asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Roland of Gilead, I find it <i>worrisome.</i>&#x201d; She smiled amiably enough, but in her eyes, the old mean light sparkled. That was the Detta Walker part of her, Roland reckoned. It would never be completely gone, and he wasn&#x2019;t sorry. Without the strange woman she had once been still buried in her heart like a chip of ice, she would have been only a handsome black woman with no legs below the knees. With Detta onboard, she was a person to be reckoned with. A dangerous one. A gunslinger.</p><p>&#x201c;He has plenty of stuff to think about,&#x201d; Eddie said quietly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been through a lot. Not every kid comes back from the dead. And it&#x2019;s like Roland says&#x2014;if someone tries to face him down, it&#x2019;s the someone who&#x2019;s apt to be sorry.&#x201d; Eddie stopped pushing the wheelchair, armed sweat from his brow, and looked at Roland. &#x201c;<i>Are </i>there someones in this particular suburb of nowhere, Roland? Or have they all moved on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, there are a few, I wot.&#x201d;</p><p>He did more than wot; they had been peeked at several times as they continued their course along the Path of the Beam. Once by a frightened woman with her arms around two children and a babe hanging in a sling from her neck. Once by an old farmer, a half-mutie with a jerking tentacle that hung from one corner of his mouth. Eddie and Susannah had seen none of these people, or sensed the others that Roland felt sure had, from the safety of the woods and high grasses, marked their progress. Eddie and Susannah had a lot to learn. </p><p>But they had learned at least some of what they would need, it seemed, because Eddie now asked, &#x201c;Are they the ones Oy keeps scenting up behind us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Roland thought of adding that he was sure something else was on Oy&#x2019;s strange little bumbler mind, and decided not to. The gunslinger had spent long years with no ka-tet, and keeping his own counsel had become a habit. One he would have to break, if the tet was to remain strong. But not now, not this morning.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s move on,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we&#x2019;ll find Jake waiting for us up ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two hours later, just shy of noon, they breasted a rise and halted, looking down at a wide, slow-moving river, gray as pewter beneath the overcast sky. On the northwestern bank&#x2014;their side&#x2014;was a barnlike building painted a green so bright it seemed to yell into the muted day. Its mouth jutted out over the water on pilings painted a similar green. Docked to two of these pilings by thick hawsers was a large raft, easily ninety feet by ninety, painted in alternating stripes of red and yellow. A tall wooden pole that looked like a mast jutted from the center, but there was no sign of a sail. Several wicker chairs sat in front of it, facing the shore on their side of the river. Jake was seated in one of these. Next to him was an old man in a vast straw hat, baggy green pants, and longboots. On his top half he wore a thin white garment&#x2014;the kind of shirt Roland thought of as a slinkum. Jake and the old man appeared to be eating well-stuffed popkins. Roland&#x2019;s mouth sprang water at the sight of them.</p><p>Oy was beyond them, at the edge of the circus-painted raft, looking raptly down at his own reflection. Or perhaps at the reflection of the steel cable that ran overhead, spanning the river.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it the Whye?&#x201d; Susannah asked Roland.</p><p>&#x201c;Yar.&#x201d;</p><p>Eddie grinned. &#x201c;You say Whye; I say Whye Not?&#x201d; He raised one hand and waved it over his head. &#x201c;Jake! Hey, Jake! Oy!&#x201d; </p><p>Jake waved back, and although the river and the raft moored at its edge were still half a mile away, their eyes were uniformly sharp, and they saw the white of the boy&#x2019;s teeth as he grinned.</p><p>Susannah cupped her hands around her mouth. &#x201c;Oy! <i>Oy! </i>To me,</p><p>sugar! Come see your mama!&#x201d;</p><p>Uttering shrill yips that were the closest he could get to barks, Oy flew across the raft, disappeared into the barnlike structure, then emerged on their side. He came charging up the path with his ears lowered against his skull and his gold-ringed eyes bright.</p><p>&#x201c;Slow down, sug, you&#x2019;ll give yourself a heart attack!&#x201d; Susannah shouted, laughing.</p><p>Oy seemed to take this as an order to speed up. He arrived at Susannah&#x2019;s wheelchair in less than two minutes, jumped up into her lap, then jumped down again and looked at them cheerfully. &#x201c;Olan! Ed! Suze!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hile, Sir Throcken,&#x201d; Roland said, using the ancient word for bumbler he&#x2019;d first heard in a book read to him by his mother: <i>The</i> <i>Throcken and the Dragon.</i></p><p>Oy lifted his leg, watered a patch of grass, then faced back the way they had come, scenting at the air, eyes on the horizon. </p><p>&#x201c;Why does he keep doing that, Roland?&#x201d; Eddie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; But he <i>almost </i>knew. Was it some old story, not The Throcken and the...</p></p><h2>Mayflower Treasure Hunt (A to Z Mysteries Super Edition, No. 2)</h2><p><p><b>Celebrate Thanksgiving at Plymouth Rock with the A to Z Mysteries gang!<br></b> <br> The hunt is on!

They live in Laurel, Maryland.Reviewed with Cheri J. Meiners' <i>Listen and Learn</i>.<p>PreS-Gr. 1. From the Learning to Get Along series, these colorful books encourage children to learn social skills. In <i>Listen</i> an African American boy explains what listening means: keeping quiet, watching the person who talks, thinking about what is being said, and asking questions when he doesn't understand. He also talks about using those skills in the classroom and at home. Similarly, in <i>Share</i> a red-haired girl learns techniques for sharing, then shows how she shares and takes turns when playing at home with her sister and friends. Each book ends with the child feeling good about using his or her new skills. The bright line-and-wash illustrations feature multiracial groups of children engaged in familiar activities. The writing is purposeful, but it is also practical in approach and sensitive to the problems and feelings of young children. A good choice for teachers seeking books that reinforce familiar classroom messages. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

You&#x2019;re giving the graduation speech at Langley High School this year,&#x201d; my dad told me as we bounced down a windy Virginia road in his open-air Jeep. Windy road plus bouncy car plus hair whipping in my face had me jangled, and I wasn&#x2019;t sure I was hearing him properly.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing the&#x2014;what?&#x201d; I asked him. Did I apply for this? I thought to myself. Is it possible I forgot I&#x2019;d said yes to giving the commencement speech at my alma mater? The way my dad put it, it seemed like the happy outcome of some contest, but it was one I didn&#x2019;t remember entering.<br> &#x201c;Remember Dick, who I play tennis with?&#x201d; &#x201c;No?&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You know. Dick? From tennis.&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2014;no, I don&#x2019;t, Dad.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Well, his granddaughter Kaitlin is graduating from Langley.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re giving the speech! Isn&#x2019;t that great?&#x201d; he said, as if it was all settled. And while I was sure there was a chink in his logic somewhere&#x2014; perhaps due to the potholes that kept jogging me out of my seat&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t find it, and by the time we arrived home, my hair a tangled mess, I had somehow become a commencement speaker.<br> As an actor, I&#x2019;d performed in front of an audience many times before, but I&#x2019;d never exactly &#x201c;spoken&#x201d; to one. So I asked for advice.<br> &#x201c;Open with a joke,&#x201d; my dad&#x2014;an experienced public speaker in his capacity as president of a company for over twenty years&#x2014;told me. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk as fast as you normally do,&#x201d; friends advised. &#x201c;Have you seen Will Ferrell&#x2019;s commencement ad-<br><br>&nbsp;<br> dress? Now <i>that&#x2019;s </i>a good speech,&#x201d; said literally every other person I asked. He&#x2019;d given a speech at USC that year that was, indeed, hilarious. He sang. It went viral. WHATEVER, WILL.<br> After I gave the speech to the Langley graduates, I was asked to publish it. &#x201c;Are you going to make it funnier? Like that Will Ferrell speech?&#x201d; people asked me when I told them the news.<br> So, this book started with the Langley speech, but grew considerably from there. I kept thinking of all the worrying I&#x2019;d done when confronted with milestone moments in life, how generally unhelpful worry is, and how much admiration I have for the young people I&#x2019;ve gotten to meet over the years. We desperately need your talent, your integrity, and your hope.

In spread after spread, the youngster learns to use her imagination. When a new girl moves in next door, Molly Lou introduces her to this new way of playing, but Gertie is stuck in the modern, TV-watching, static-toy world. Of course, Molly Lou is eventually able to turn the tide, showing that imagination rules. The protagonist is a large-headed, bug-eyed girl living in a bright green and pink springtime cartoon world filled with details that will keep young readers busy. Catrow's cartoon-style pencil, watercolor, and collage illustrations match Molly Lou's lavish imagination. The book could have become didactic and preachy, but words and pictures work well to present a straightforward lesson on the value of good old-fashioned play.-Angela J.

Campbell classic about an antarctic research camp that discovers and thaws the ancient, frozen body of a crash-landed alien. The creature revives with terrifying results, shape-shifting to assume the exact form of animal and man, alike. Paranoia ensues as a band of frightened men work to discern friend from foe, and destroy the menace before it challenges all of humanity! The story, hailed as &#34;one of the finest science fiction novellas ever written&#34; by the SF Writers of America, is best known to fans as THE THING, as it was the basis of Howard Hawks&#39; The Thing From Another World in 1951, and John Carpenter&#39;s The Thing in 1982. With a new Introduction by William F. Nolan, author of Logan&#39;s Run, and his never-before-published, suspenseful Screen Treatment written for Universal Studios in 1978, this is a must-have edition for scifi and horror fans!</p><p>This edition features William F. Nolan&#39;s (&#34;Logan&#39;s Run&#34;, &#34;Burnt Offerings&#34;) never-before-published SCREEN TREATMENT of &#34;Who Goes There?&#34; (THE THING), written for Universal Studios in 1978, a scary, suspenseful, cinematic take on Campbell&#39;s story. Nolan also penned the Introduction, discussing Campbell&#39;s importance to the SF genre and Nolan&#39;s personal involvement with the story."The most powerful force in science fiction ever." - Isaac Asimov <p>John Wood Campbell, Jr. (June 8, 1910 - July 11, 1971) remains a towering figure in science fiction. His influence, first as a writer, later as editor of Astounding Science Fiction (Analog) transformed the field, shaping the golden age of science fiction and producing SF legends, Robert A. Heinlein, A. E. van Vogt, Theodore Sturgeon and Isaac Asimov. </p><p>WHO GOES THERE? is best known to science fiction and horror film fans as THE THING because it is the story that formed the basis of Howard Hawks' THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD (1951) and John Carpenter's THE THING (1982). But to ardent readers of SF literature, it is the legendary SF-suspense classic penned by none other than John W. Campbell. With its vivid ensemble of characters, forbidding antarctic setting, and an unforgettably original creature at the center of all the action, the story well deserves its legendary status; it was voted "one of the finest science fiction novellas ever written" by the Science Fiction Writers of America. This all-new edition features an Introduction by William F. Nolan (Logan's Run, Burnt Offerings), and includes his never-before-published Screen Treatment of the story. Written for Universal Studios in 1978, Nolan's scary, suspenseful, cinematic take on Who Goes There? truly makes this a must-have edition for fans of Campbell and THE THING motion pictures.</p></p><h2>Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!: 4 Keys to Unlock Your Business Potential</h2><p>Simple Numbers can guide you to increased business profitability!

By the author of Poppleton. Simultaneous.</p><p>As a child in West Virginia, Cynthia Rylant never dreamed of becoming a writer. In her free time, she devoured Archie comic books and paperback romances and enjoyed the outdoors. But after taking one college English class, she was, hooked on great writing I didn&#x2019;t know about this part of me until I went to college-didn&#x2019;t know I loved beautiful stories.&#x201d; And one night, inspired by the Southern writer James Agee, she sat down and wrote When I Was Young in the Mountains. Named a Caldecott Honor Book and an ALA Notable Book, it was an instant success.<br><br>Since that night, Rylant hasn&#x2019;t stopped creating wonderful books. Her stories explore friendship, love, grief, and other mysteries, and often draw on her memories of growing up in Appalachia. I get a lot of personal gratification thinking of those people who don&#x2019;t get any attention in the world and making them really valuable in my fiction-making them absolutely shine with their beauty.&#x201d;<br><br>She lives with her many pets in the Pacific Northwest.<br>Mark Teague is an award-winning children's book author and illustrator whose books include the NEW YORK TIMES bestselling How Do Dinosaurs... series, the LaRue series, FIREHOUSE!, FUNNY FARM, and many other humorous picture books. Mark lives in New York state with his wife and their two daughters.Kindergarten-Grade 2-This is the fourth book about this lovable pig. In the first chapter, Poppleton's small tree seems to be withering. Hudson the mouse suggests feeding it cheese, but it is Cherry Sue the llama who comes up with the idea of a bird feeder, which is just what the lonely tree needs. In the second episode, poor Poppleton is fighting off a cold. Cherry Sue comes by with a basket of oranges. Unfortunately, every time he gets one peeled, he sneezes, and it flies all over the room. In the final selection, Poppleton is wallpapering his house. Hudson proves to be too small to be of much help, Fillmore the goat keeps eating the paper, and Cherry Sue's fur gets caught in the paste. When his friends offer to change themselves in order to be more helpful, Poppleton realizes how special they are and switches to paint-which is much easier for everyone. Rylant's text is simple, and the layout of only one or two sentences per page, plus the separate chapters, make the book easy to read. These qualities also make it a good read-aloud choice. Teague's warm and funny illustrations capture the spirit of Poppleton and his companions wonderfully. A great addition to any collection.<br><i>Dina Sherman, Brooklyn Children's Museum, NY</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Skeptic&#39;s Guide to the Universe</h2><p><b>The <i>USA TODAY</i> bestseller </b><b>is now in paperback with a new chapter on Global Warming!

But plenty of excitement (and shocks) are coming Jack's way once his mom loans him out to help a feisty old neighbor with a most unusual chore&#x2015;typewriting obituaries filled with stories about the people who founded his utopian town. As one obituary leads to another, Jack is launched on a strange adventure involving molten wax, Eleanor Roosevelt, twisted promises, a homemade airplane, Girl Scout cookies, a man on a trike, a dancing plague, voices from the past, Hells Angels . . . and possibly murder. </p><p>Endlessly surprising, this sly, sharp-edged narrative is the author at his very best, making readers laugh out loud at the most unexpected things in a dead-funny depiction of growing up in a slightly off-kilter place where the past is present, the present is confusing, and the future is completely up in the air.</p></p><p><b>Jack Gantos</b> has written books for people of all ages, from picture books and middle-grade fiction to novels for young adults and adults. His works include <i>Hole in My Life</i>, a memoir that won the Michael L. Printz and Robert F.

I was holding a pair of camouflage Japanese WWII binoculars to my eyes and focusing across her newly planted vegetable garden, and her cornfield, and over ancient Miss Volker&#x2019;s roof, and then up the Norvelt road, and past the brick bell tower on my school, and beyond the Community Center, and the tall silver whistle on top of the volunteer fire department to the most distant dark blue hill, which is where the screen for the Viking drive-in movie theater had recently been erected.<br>Down by my feet I had laid out all the Japanese army souvenirs Dad had shipped home from the war. He had been in the navy, and after a Pacific island invasion in the Solomons he and some other sailor buddies had blindly crawled around at night and found a bunker of dead Japanese soldiers half buried in the sand. They stripped everything military off of them and dragged the loot back to their camp. Dad had an officer&#x2019;s sword with what he said was real dried blood along the razor-sharp edge of the long blade. He had a Japanese flag, a sniper&#x2019;s rifle with a full ammo clip, a dented canteen, a pair of dirty white gloves with a scorched hole shot right through the bloody palm of the left hand, and a color-tinted photo of an elegant Japanese woman in a kimono. Of course he also had the powerful binoculars I was using.<br>I knew Mom had come to ruin my fun, so I thought I would distract her and maybe she&#x2019;d forget what was on her mind.<br>&#x201c;Hey, Mom,&#x201d; I said matter-of-factly with the binoculars still pressed against my face, &#x201c;how come blood on a sword dries red, and blood on cloth dries brown? How come?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Honey,&#x201d; Mom replied, sticking with what was on her mind, &#x201c;does your dad know you have all this dangerous war stuff out?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He always lets me play with it as long as I&#x2019;m careful,&#x201d; I said, which wasn&#x2019;t true. In fact, he never let me play with it, because as he put it, &#x201c;This swag will be worth a bundle of money someday, so keep your grubby hands off it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, don&#x2019;t hurt yourself,&#x201d; Mom warned. &#x201c;And if there is blood on some of that stuff, don&#x2019;t touch it. You might <i>catch</i> something, like Japanese polio.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you mean Japanese <i>beetles</i>?&#x201d; I asked. She had an invasion of those in her garden that were winning the plant war.<br>She didn&#x2019;t answer my question. Instead, she switched back to why she came to speak to me in the first place. &#x201c;I just got a call from Miss Volker. She needs a few minutes of your time in the morning, so I told her I&#x2019;d send you down.&#x201d;<br>I gazed at my mom through the binoculars but she was too close to bring into focus. Her face was just a hazy pink cupcake with strawberry icing.<br>&#x201c;And,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;Miss Volker said she would give you a little <i>something</i> for your help, but I don&#x2019;t want you to take any money. You can take a slice of pie but no money. We never help neighbors for cash.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Pie? That&#x2019;s all I get?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Pie? But what if it makes her feel good to give me money?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t make <i>me</i> feel good if she gives you money,&#x201d; she stressed. &#x201c;And it shouldn&#x2019;t make you feel good either. Helping others is a far greater reward than doing it for money.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, giving in to her before she pushed me in. &#x201c;What time?&#x201d;<br>Mom looked away from me for a moment and stared over at War Chief, my uncle Will&#x2019;s Indian pony, who was grinding his chunky yellow teeth. He was working up a sweat from scratching his itchy side back and forth against the rough bark on a prickly oak. About a month ago my uncle visited us when he got a pass from the army. He used to work for the county road department and for kicks he had painted big orange and white circles with reflective paint all over War Chief&#x2019;s hair. He said it made War Chief look like he was getting ready to battle General Custer. But War Chief was only battling the paint which wouldn&#x2019;t wash off, and it had been driving him crazy. Mom said the army had turned her younger brother Will from being a &#x201c;nice kid&#x201d; to being a &#x201c;confused jerk.&#x201d;<br>Earlier, the pony had been rubbing himself against the barbed wire around the turkey coop, but the long-necked turkeys got all riled up and pecked his legs. It had been so long since a farrier had trimmed War Chief&#x2019;s hooves that he hobbled painfully around the yard like a crippled ballerina. It was sad. If my uncle gave me the pony I&#x2019;d take really good care of him, but he wouldn&#x2019;t give him up.<br>&#x201c;Miss Volker will need you there at six in the morning,&#x201d; Mom said casually, &#x201c;but she said you were welcome to come earlier if you wanted.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Six!&#x201d; I cried. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even have to get up that early for school, and now that I&#x2019;m on my summer vacation I want to sleep in. Why does she need me so early?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She said she has an important project with a deadline and she&#x2019;ll need you as early as she can get you.&#x201d;<br>I lifted my binoculars back toward the movie. The Japanese were snaking through the low palmettos toward the last few marines on Wake Island. One of the young marines was holding a prayer book and looking toward heaven, which was a sure Hollywood sign he was about to die with a slug to a vital organ. Then the scene cut to a young Japanese soldier aiming his sniper rifle, which looked just like mine. Then the film cut back to the young marine, and just as he crossed himself with the &#x201c;Father, Son, and Holy&#x2014;&#x201d; <i>BANG!</i> He clutched his heart and slumped over.<br>&#x201c;Yikes!&#x201d; I called out. &#x201c;They plugged him!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is that a war movie?&#x201d; Mom asked sharply, pointing toward the screen and squinting as if she were looking directly into the flickering projector.<br>&#x201c;Not entirely,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s more of a <i>love</i> war movie.&#x201d; I lied. It was <i>totally</i> a war movie except for when the soon-to-be-dead marines talked about their girlfriends, but I threw in the word <i>love</i> because I thought she wouldn&#x2019;t say what she said next.<br>&#x201c;You know I don&#x2019;t like you watching war movies,&#x201d; she scolded me with her hands on her hips. &#x201c;All that violence is bad for you&#x2014;plus it gets you <i>worked up</i>.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I <i>know</i>, Mom,&#x201d; I replied with as much huffiness in my voice as I thought I could get away with. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do I need to remind you of your <i>little</i> problem?&#x201d; she asked.<br>How could I forget? I was a <i>nosebleeder</i>. The moment something startled me or whenever I got overexcited or spooked about any little thing blood would spray out of my nose holes like dragon flames.<br>&#x201c;I <i>know</i>,&#x201d; I said to her, and instinctively swiped a finger under my nose to check for blood. &#x201c;You remind me of my <i>little</i> problem all day long.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know the doctor thinks it&#x2019;s the sign of a <i>bigger</i> problem,&#x201d; she said seriously. &#x201c;If you have iron-poor blood you may not be getting enough oxygen to your brain.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Can you just leave, please?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be disrespectful,&#x201d; she said, reminding me of my manners, but I was already obsessing about my bleeding-nose problem. When Dad&#x2019;s old Chevy truck backfired I showered blood across the sidewalk. When I fell off the pony and landed on my butt my nose spewed blood down over my chest. At night, if I had a disturbing dream then my nose leaked through the pillow. I swear, with the blood I was losing I needed a transfusion about every other day. Something had to be wrong with me, but one really good advantage about being dirt-poor is that you can&#x2019;t afford to go to the doctor and get bad news.<br>&#x201c;Jack!&#x201d; my mom called, and reached forward to poke my kneecap. &#x201c;Jack! Are you listening? Come into the house soon. You&#x2019;ll have to get to bed early now that you have morning plans.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, and felt my fun evening leap off a cliff as she walked back toward the kitchen door. I knew she was still soaking the dishes in the sink so I had a little more time. Once she was out of sight I turned back to what I had been planning all along. I lifted the binoculars and focused in on the movie screen. The Japanese hadn&#x2019;t quite finished off all the marines and I figured I&#x2019;d be a marine too and help defend them. I knew we wouldn&#x2019;t be fighting the Japanese anymore because they were now our friends, but it was good to use movie enemies for target practice because Dad said I had to get ready to fight off the Russian Commies who had already sneaked into the country and were planning to launch a surprise attack. I put down the binoculars and removed the ammo clip on the sniper rifle then aimed it toward the screen where I could just make out the small images. There was no scope on the rifle so I had to use the regular sight&#x2014;the kind where you lined up a little metal ball on the far end of the barrel with the V-notch above the trigger where you pressed your cheek and eye to the cool wooden stock. The rifle weighed a ton. I hoisted it up and tried to aim at the movie screen, but the barrel shook back and forth so wildly I couldn&#x2019;t get the ball to line up inside the V. I lowered the rifle and took a deep breath. I knew I didn&#x2019;t have all night to play because of Mom, so I gave it another try as the Japanese made their final &#x201c;Banzai!&#x201d; assault.<br>I lifted the rifle again and swung the tip of the barrel straight up into the air. I figured I could gradually lower the barrel at the screen, aim, and pick off one of the Japanese troops. With all my strength I slo...</p><h2>Al Capone Shines My Shoes (Tales from Alcatraz)</h2><p>What do you do when your neighbors are a bunch of hit men, con men, and mad dog murderers?

The convicts on Alcatraz are rotten to the core, crazy in the head, and as slippery as eels in axle grease.</p><p>And then there&#x2019;s me. Moose Flanagan. I live on Alcatraz along with twenty-four other kids and one more on the way. My father works as a prison guard and an electrician in the cell house up top. I live where most of us &#x201c;civilians&#x201d; do, in 64 building, which is dockside on the east side of Alcatraz&#x2014;a base hit from the mobster Al Capone.</p><p>Not many twelve-year-old boys can say that. Not many kids can say that when their toilet is stopped up, they get Seven Fingers, the ax murderer, to help them out, either. Even simple things are upside down and backwards here. Take getting my socks washed. Every Wednesday we put out our dirty laundry in big white bags marked with our name: FLANAGAN. Every Monday our clothes come back starched, pressed, folded, and smelling of soap and flour. They look like my mom washed them for me.</p><p>Except she didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>My laundry man is Alcatraz #85: Al Capone. He has help, of course. Machine Gun Kelly works right alongside him in the laundry along with thirty other no-name hit men, con men, mad dog murderers, and a handful of bank robbers too.</p><p>They do a good job washing the clothes for us and most everyone else on the island. But sometimes they do a little extra.</p><p>The cons don&#x2019;t care for Officer Trixle, so his laundry doesn&#x2019;t return the same way as everyone else&#x2019;s. His shirts are missing buttons, underwear is stiff with starch or dyed pansy pink, pants are missing a cuff or the fly is sewn shut so the guy can&#x2019;t even take a leak unless he pulls his pants down like a little girl.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t say the cons are wrong about Officer Trixle. Darby Trixle is the kind of guy who only his wife likes&#x2014;and not that much either. Last Saturday my best friend Jimmy Mattaman and I were looking for a barrel for Jimmy&#x2019;s fly menagerie, and Janet Trixle, Darby&#x2019;s seven-year-old daughter, just happened to see we were walking by the Black Mariah, the Alcatraz paddy wagon. That was all we were doing&#x2014;<i>walking by it</i>. But when Darby saw the Mariah had a flat tire, who do you think got the blame?</p><p>Yours truly.</p><p>It couldn&#x2019;t have been Darby drove over a nail. Oh no. It had to have been us. We had to go with him to San Francisco and carry a new tire down Van Ness Avenue, to the ferry and up the switchback, to where the Mariah was parked up top. Darby wouldn&#x2019;t even let us roll it on the road. Didn&#x2019;t want it to get dirty. It&#x2019;s a tire! Where does he think it usually goes?</p><p>My father wouldn&#x2019;t help us with Darby either. &#x201c;I know you had nothing to do with that flat tire, but it won&#x2019;t hurt you to give Darby a hand, Moose,&#x201d; is what he said.</p><p>When I first moved here, I thought all the bad guys were on one side of the bars and all the good guys were on the other. But lately, I&#x2019;ve begun to wonder if there isn&#x2019;t at least one officer on the free side who ought to be locked up and maybe a convict who isn&#x2019;t half as bad as he&#x2019;s cracked up to be. I&#x2019;m thinking about Al Capone&#x2014;the most notorious gangster in America, the worst guy we have up top. How could it be that he did me a good turn?</p><p>It doesn&#x2019;t make sense, does it? But Al Capone got my sister, Natalie, into a school called the Esther P. Marinoff where she&#x2019;d been turned down twice already. It&#x2019;s a boarding school for kids who have their wires crossed up. It&#x2019;s a school and not a school . . . a place to make her normal.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know for certain it was Capone who helped us. I mean the guy is locked up in a five-by-nine-foot cell. He&#x2019;s not allowed to make a phone call or write a letter that isn&#x2019;t censored word for word. It doesn&#x2019;t seem possible he could have done anything to help us, even if he wanted to.</p><p>But out of desperation, I sent a letter asking Capone for help and Natalie got accepted. Then I got a note in the pocket of my newly laundered shirt: <i>Done,</i> it said.</p><p>I haven&#x2019;t told anyone about this. It&#x2019;s something I try not to think about, but today, the day Nat&#x2019;s finally leaving for school, I can&#x2019;t keep my mind from going over the details again and again.</p><p>The thing that stumps me is <i>why</i>. I never even met Al Capone . . . why would he help me?</p><p>I watch Nat as she sits on the living room floor going through our books one by one. She looks almost like a regular sixteen-year-old this morning, if her mouth wasn&#x2019;t twitching right and right and right again and her shoulders were just down where they&#x2019;re supposed to be. She opens a book, fans her face with the pages, then sets the book back on the shelf, just exactly as it was. She has been through one entire shelf this way. Now she&#x2019;s working on the second.</p><p>Normally, my mom wouldn&#x2019;t let her do this, but today she doesn&#x2019;t want to take the chance of upsetting her.</p><p>&#x201c;You ready to go, Natalie?&#x201d; my mother asks.</p><p>Nat moves faster. She fans the pages so quickly each book sounds like one quick <i>ffffrrrt</i>. All I hear is <i>ffffrrrt ffffrrrt ffffrrrt</i> as I look out our front window down to the dock. Sure enough there&#x2019;s Officer Trixle. He&#x2019;s supposed to be off today, but Trixle can&#x2019;t keep his nose out of our business. He&#x2019;s almost as much trouble as Piper, the warden&#x2019;s daughter&#x2014;only not half as pretty. When you look like Piper does, people forgive a whole lot of things, but never mind about that. What I think about Piper is kind of embarrassing, to tell you the truth.</p><p>My father comes out of the bathroom. The toilet is running again. The plumbing in 64 building is held together with bubble gum and last year&#x2019;s oatmeal stuck hard and solid. But luckily for us, Seven Fingers, our very own felon plumber, fixes it for free. Not exactly for free actually. We pay him a chocolate bar every time, but no one is supposed to know that.</p><p>&#x201c;Time to go, Natalie,&#x201d; my mom says.</p><p>Natalie is wearing a new yellow dress today. My mother cut the pattern, but the convicts in the tailor shop sewed it. The cons did a pretty good job. Only the belt is bugging Nat. She pulls at it, weaving it in and out of the loops. In and out. In and out. Nat&#x2019;s mouth puckers to one side. &#x201c;Moose school. Natalie home,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>&#x201c;Not today,&#x201d; my mother says brightly. &#x201c;Today is your big day. Today <i>you&#x2019;re</i> going to school.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Not</i> today,&#x201d; Nat tells her. &#x201c;<i>Not</i> today. <i>Not</i> today.&#x201d;</p><p>I can&#x2019;t help smiling at this. Natalie likes to repeat what you say and here she&#x2019;s repeating my mom&#x2019;s exact words with a change of inflection that makes them say what Natalie wants them to say and not at all what my mother meant. I love when Natalie outsmarts Mom this way. Sometimes Nat is smarter than we are. Other times, she doesn&#x2019;t understand the first thing about anything. That&#x2019;s the trouble with Natalie&#x2014;you never know which way she&#x2019;ll go.</p><p>The first time Nat went to the Esther P. Marinoff School she pitched a fit the size of Oklahoma and they kicked her out, but I don&#x2019;t think that will happen this time. She&#x2019;s getting better in her own weird way. I used to say Nat&#x2019;s like a human adding machine without the human part, but now she&#x2019;s touching down human more days than not. And each time she does it feels as if the sun has come out after sixty straight days of rain.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell her, Moose. Tell her how wonderful it&#x2019;s going to be,&#x201d; my mother says.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell her, Moose. Tell her how wonderful it&#x2019;s going to be,&#x201d; Nat repeats, picking up her button box and holding it tight against her chest.</p><p>&#x201c;You get to take your buttons, Nat. <i>Mom</i> said,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>I almost think I see her smile then&#x2014;as much of a smile as you ever get from Natalie anyway. She peeks inside her button box, checking to make sure all of her precious buttons are exactly where they&#x2019;re supposed to be.</p><p>When we head down to the dock, my mom&#x2019;s step is light on the stairs. She&#x2019;s so sure that the Esther P. Marinoff will be the thing that fixes Natalie. My dad&#x2019;s feet are moving to the beat of an Irish jig. Natalie is taking each step carefully and methodically as if she wants each foot to make a lasting impression on the stairs.</p><p>When we get down to the water&#x2019;s edge I see Trixle walking across the dock, bullhorn in hand.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Two hundred yards back please! All boats must stay two hundred yards off the shore!</i>&#x201d; Officer Trixle booms through his bullhorn to a tour boat that has come too close to the island.</p><p>&#x201c;Warned him before, that one. Mac&#x2019;ll put a bead on him. Fix &#x2019;em good,&#x201d; Trixle tells my father.</p><p>Natalie hates loud noises. Once they shot a warning blast into the water when we were in our apartment and she curled up in a ball in the middle of the living room and stayed that way for the better part of the afternoon. Another time she didn&#x2019;t seem to hear a gun go off ten feet away. It&#x2019;s impossible to predict what Natalie will do.</p><p>&#x201c;Darby, hey Darby . . .&#x201d; my father wheedles. &#x201c;Please&#x2014;not today, okay, buddy?&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Moonbear&#39;s Shadow</h2><p>Moonbear tries to outwit his troublesome shadow in this charming reissue of a beloved classic by award-winning author and illustrator Frank Asch.<br><br>One sunny day Bear decides to go fishing, but his shadow keeps scaring the fish away, time and time again.

But perhaps a Jedi&#x2019;s most essential duty is to pass on what they have learned. Master Yoda trained Dooku; Dooku trained Qui-Gon Jinn; and now Qui-Gon has a Padawan of his own. But while Qui-Gon has faced all manner of threats and danger as a Jedi, nothing has ever scared him like the thought of failing his apprentice.<br><br> Obi-Wan Kenobi has deep respect for his Master, but struggles to understand him. Why must Qui-Gon so often disregard the laws that bind the Jedi? Why is Qui-Gon drawn to ancient Jedi prophecies instead of more practical concerns? And why wasn&#x2019;t Obi-Wan told that Qui-Gon is considering an invitation to join the Jedi Council&#x2014;knowing it would mean the end of their partnership? The simple answer scares him: Obi-Wan has failed his Master.<br><br> When Jedi Rael Averross, another former student of Dooku, requests their assistance with a political dispute, Jinn and Kenobi travel to the royal court of Pijal for what may be their final mission together. What should be a simple assignment quickly becomes clouded by deceit, and by visions of violent disaster that take hold in Qui-Gon&#x2019;s mind. As Qui-Gon&#x2019;s faith in prophecy grows, Obi-Wan&#x2019;s faith in him is tested&#x2014;just as a threat surfaces that will demand that Master and apprentice come together as never before, or be divided forever.</p><p><b>Claudia Gray</b> is the author of <i>Star Wars: Bloodline; Star Wars: Leia, Princess of Alderaan; </i>and <i>Star Wars: Lost Stars</i>.

She lives in New Orleans.As ever, after a mission, Qui-Gon had been summoned to the Jedi Council&#x2019;s chambers for his report. It was nighttime&#x2014;later than the Council usually met, at least for ordinary business&#x2014;and the darkness around them was illuminated by the cyclone of Coruscanti traffic and ships&#x2019; lights. Yet here, within this room, a sense of serenity prevailed. Qui-Gon relished the contrast.<br><br> Master Billaba leaned forward, studying her datapad with a frown on her face. &#x201c;It worries me, this misunderstanding between you and your Padawan. This isn&#x2019;t the first time you&#x2019;ve reported such difficulties.&#x201d;<br> Qui-Gon bowed his head slightly. &#x201c;It worries me as well. Obi-Wan is strong in the Force, and eager to do his duty. The failure must be mine. Fundamentally, I fear, we are a mismatch. I&#x2019;ve been unable to adapt my teaching methods to his needs, despite my best efforts.&#x201d;<br><br> Yoda cocked his head. &#x201c;Adapt he must as well. Cooperation is learned not through individual effort. Only together can you progress.&#x201d;<br><br> Agreeing to that proposition&#x2014;sensible though it was&#x2014;would mean shifting some of the blame onto Obi-Wan, which Qui-Gon preferred not to do. He simply remained quiet. The Jedi Council had a habit of assuming that silence equaled agreement; Qui-Gon had found this habit useful, from time to time.<br><br> Regardless, he expected the Council to eventually ask him if he wanted them to reassign Obi-Wan&#x2019;s training to another Master. He&#x2019;d known before this meeting began that they might even ask the ques�tion tonight, but he still wasn&#x2019;t sure what he would say. The suspense seemed worse than he would&#x2019;ve anticipated, maybe because he didn&#x2019;t know what he wanted to answer . . . <br><br> . . . or because the silence in the room had lasted a suspiciously long period of time.<br><br> Qui-Gon focused his attention back on the Masters surrounding him. They were exchanging glances in what seemed to be anticipation. He straightened. &#x201c;Have you another mission for us?&#x201d; Maybe they in�tended to test him and Obi-Wan one more time before any decision about reassignment would be made.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, another task for you we have.&#x201d; Yoda&#x2019;s ears lowered, a sign of deep intent. &#x201c;Consider it carefully, you must.&#x201d;<br><br> Mace Windu drew himself upright and folded his hands together in a formal gesture of respect. &#x201c;You may not have heard that Master Dapatian intends to retire from the Council, effective next month.&#x201d;<br><br> Qui-Gon glanced at Poli Dapatian, a Master of great renown . . . so much so that Qui-Gon had failed to note, in recent years, how aged he had become. &#x201c;That is our loss.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We hope it will also be our gain,&#x201d; Mace replied. &#x201c;Qui-Gon Jinn, we hereby offer you a seat on the Jedi Council.&#x201d;<br><br>Had he misheard? No, he hadn&#x2019;t. Qui-Gon slowly gazed around the circle, taking in the expressions of each Council member in turn. Some of them looked amused, others pleased. A few of them, Yoda included, appeared more rueful than not. But they were serious.<br><br> &#x201c;I admit&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve surprised me,&#x201d; Qui-Gon finally said.<br><br> &#x201c;I imagine so,&#x201d; Mace said drily. &#x201c;A few years ago, we would&#x2019;ve been astonished to learn we would ever consider this. But in the time since, we&#x2019;ve all changed. We&#x2019;ve grown. Which means the possibilities have changed as well.&#x201d;<br><br>Qui-Gon took a moment to collect himself. Without any warning, one of the turning points of his life had arrived. Everything he said and did in the next days would be of great consequence. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve argued with my methods often as not, or perhaps you&#x2019;d say I&#x2019;ve argued with yours.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Truth, this is,&#x201d; Yoda said.<br><br> Depa Billaba gave Yoda a look Qui-Gon couldn&#x2019;t interpret. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s also true that the Jedi Council needs more perspectives.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Is the Council actually making sense? </i>Qui-Gon hoped none of them had picked up on that thought.<br><br> Mace nodded. &#x201c;Yes, Qui-Gon, we&#x2019;ve disagreed often. Butted heads, even. But you&#x2019;ve always acted with respect for the Council&#x2019;s authority, without compromising your inner convictions. This shows a great gift for&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Diplomacy?&#x201d; Qui-Gon asked.<br><br> Mace replied, &#x201c;I was going to say <i>balance.</i>&#x201d;<br><br> It was a delicate line to walk, one Qui-Gon had stumbled over on many occasions. But those occasions had become rarer as the years went on. He&#x2019;d learned how to handle the Council well enough. Now, it seemed, the Council had become ready to hear him in return.<br><br> Qui-Gon had never imagined sitting on the Jedi Council itself, at least not since he was a youngling. Dooku had chuckled once, early in Qui-Gon&#x2019;s training, when they spoke of the Council. <i>&#x201c;You have your own mind, my Padawan,&#x201d; </i>he&#x2019;d said. <i>&#x201c;The Council doesn&#x2019;t always re�spond well to that.&#x201d; </i>Given how many times Qui-Gon had clashed with the Council&#x2014;from his earliest days as a Jedi Knight up to six weeks ago&#x2014;he&#x2019;d always assumed that he would never ascend to the heights of the Order.<br><br> But now it could happen. <i>Would </i>happen. He&#x2019;d be able to weigh in on the Council&#x2019;s decisions, and perhaps create some of the change he wanted to see. It was the greatest opportunity of his life.<br><br> &#x201c;You honor me,&#x201d; Qui-Gon said. &#x201c;I ask for some time to meditate upon this before I accept.&#x201d; Of course he would take the seat on the Council. But in doing so, he wanted to more fully reflect upon how this would change him, and the breadth of the important role he would assume.<br><br> &#x201c;Very wise,&#x201d; said Depa. &#x201c;Most of those asked to join the Council do the same, myself included. If someone didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;well, I&#x2019;d think maybe he didn&#x2019;t know what he was getting into.&#x201d;<br><br> Laughter went around the room. Amusement bubbled within Poli Dapatian&#x2019;s respirator mask. Depa Billaba&#x2019;s grin was infectious, and Qui-Gon realized he was smiling back at her. Although the Council had never been hostile to him, this was the first time Qui-Gon had felt a deeper camaraderie&#x2014;the friendliness of equals. Already Teth and the Hutts seemed like a problem from years ago. The future shone so boldly that it threatened to eclipse the present.<br><br> <i>Steady, </i>he told himself. <i>Even an invitation to the Jedi Council mustn&#x2019;t go to your head.<br></i><br> &#x201c;Consider carefully, you must,&#x201d; said Yoda, the only member of the Council who remained gravely serious. &#x201c;No hasty answer should you give.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Qui-Gon said. Hadn&#x2019;t he just indicated that he in�tended to do exactly that?<br><br> Before he could think more on it, Mace said, &#x201c;In some ways, this invitation comes at an opportune time. This change could, potentially, resolve other problems.&#x201d;<br><br>Only then did it hit Qui-Gon: If he took a seat on the Council, then Obi-Wan would be transferred to another Master.</p><h2>The Old Guard Book One: Opening Fire</h2><p>Collecting the critically acclaimed mini-series by Greg Rucka and Leandro Fernandez.

It's a perfect window into the crosscurrents of today's world, with all its joys and sorrows. In this remarkably insightful, wide-ranging work of reportage, Franklin Foer takes us on a surprising tour through the world of soccer, shining a spotlight on the clash of civilizations, the international economy, and just about everything in between. <i>How Soccer Explains the World</i> is an utterly original book that makes sense of our troubled times. </p></p><p>The global power of soccer might be a little hard for Americans, living in a country that views the game with the same skepticism used for the metric system and the threat of killer bees, to grasp fully. But in Europe, South America, and elsewhere, soccer is not merely a pastime but often an expression of the social, economic, political, and racial composition of the communities that host both the teams and their throngs of enthusiastic fans. New Republic editor Franklin Foer, a lifelong devotee of soccer dating from his own inept youth playing days to an adulthood of obsessive fandom, examines soccer's role in various cultures as a means of examining the reach of globalization. Foer's approach is long on soccer reportage, providing extensive history and fascinating interviews on the Rangers-Celtic rivalry and the inner workings of AC Milan, and light on direct discussion of issues like world trade and the exportation of Western culture. But by creating such a compelling narrative of soccer around the planet, Foer draws the reader into these sport-mad societies, and subtly provides the explanations he promises in chapters with titles like "How Soccer Explains the New Oligarchs", "How Soccer Explains Islam's Hope", and "How Soccer Explains the Sentimental Hooligan." Foer's own passion for the game gives his book an infectious energy but still pales in comparison to the religious fervor of his subjects. His portraits of legendary hooligans in Serbia and Britain, in particular, make the most die-hard roughneck New York Yankees fan look like a choirboy in comparison. Beyond the thugs, Foer also profiles Nigerian players living in the Ukraine, Iranian women struggling against strict edicts to attend matches, and the parallel worlds of Brazilian soccer and politics from which Pele emerged and returned. Foer posits that globalization has eliminated neither local cultural identities nor violent hatred among fans of rival teams, and it has not washed out local businesses in a sea of corporate wealth nor has it quelled rampant local corruption. Readers with an interest in international economics are sure to like <i>How Soccer Explains the World</i>, but soccer fans will love it. <i>--John Moe</i><p>Franklin Foer is the editor of <em>The New Republic</em>.

He Lives in New York City.<br><br><b>Anoosha Syed</b>&nbsp;is an illustrator and character&nbsp;designer for animation. She lives in Toronto.<b><br></b><b>Neil deGrasse Tyson</b><br><br>One starry night, in the autumn of 1957, the life of&nbsp;nine-year-old Neil deGrasse Tyson&#x2019; changed forever.&nbsp;In the middle of a vast, domed amphitheater, the house&nbsp;lights dimmed and a booming voice announced: "We are now in the universe, and here are the stars."<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Comets streaked. Planets whirled. The moon waxed&nbsp;and the constellations appeared. A meteor vaporized,&nbsp;leaving a glowing trail in its wake. Seated in the dark,&nbsp;Neil was transfixed by a celestial light show the likes of&nbsp;which he had never seen.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was Neil&#x2019;s first visit to a planetarium&#x2014;the&nbsp;Hayden Planetarium in New York City&#x2014;and his first&nbsp;encounter with the wonders of astronomy, the science&nbsp;of observing the sky.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the lights rose, Neil realized that what he&nbsp;had just seen was only an amazing simulation projected&nbsp;onto the theater&#x2019;s dome. Nevertheless, Neil&#x2019;s interest&nbsp;had been piqued, and his imagination fired. He decided&nbsp;then and there that he wanted to follow the stars for the&nbsp;rest of his life.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The study of the universe would be my career,&#x201d; he&nbsp;said later, &#x201c;and no force on Earth would stop me.&#x201d; From&nbsp;then on, whenever someone asked Neil what he wanted&nbsp;to be when he grew up, he proudly answered: "I'm going to be an astrophysicist!"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What seemed like a journey of a thousand light&nbsp;years was in fact just a short ride on a subway. Neil&nbsp;grew up in New York City, not far from the Hayden&nbsp;Planetarium, in the Castle Hill neighborhood of the&nbsp;Bronx. Later, he lived in Riverdale, in the fittingly&nbsp;named Skyview Apartments. Neil was the second of&nbsp;three children. Both his parents worked for the U.S.&nbsp;government.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neil attended public school in New York City, and&nbsp;he did not distinguish himself in the classroom. One&nbsp;teacher complained on his report card that Neil should&nbsp;spend less time socializing and more time studying.&nbsp;&#x201c;Your son laughs too loud,&#x201d; another remarked to Neil&#x2019;s&nbsp;mother during a parent-teacher conference.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But there was one teacher who saw potential in the&nbsp;young boy. She knew that Neil was interested in the&nbsp;stars and planets. So when she saw a newspaper ad for&nbsp;an astronomy class at the Hayden Planetarium, she cut&nbsp;it out and gave it to him.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The visit to the planetarium left Neil feeling that the&nbsp;universe was calling him to study it. But he still didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;know how. Then, one day, a friend named Phillip lent&nbsp;him a pair of binoculars.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What am I supposed to do with these?&#x201d; Neil wondered.&nbsp;&#x201c;Look in people&#x2019;s windows?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, silly,&#x201d; Phillip said. &#x201c;Look up!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And when Neil did, he saw a whole new world of&nbsp;wonder. That night, he used the binoculars to gaze up&nbsp;at the moon, mesmerized by the giant craters on its&nbsp;surface. Magnified by the binoculars, the moon was no&nbsp;longer just a circle in the sky&#x2014;it was another world&nbsp;waiting to be explored.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then, when Neil was eleven years old, his parents&nbsp;gave him his first telescope. It was small, but it seemed&nbsp;infinitely more powerful than the binoculars. Now Neil&nbsp;could see way past the moon to the planets beyond.&nbsp;Even far-off Saturn, whose majestic rings Neil had read&nbsp;about, seemed as close and as clear as his own outstretched&nbsp;hand.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neil could not get enough of his new hobby. In fact,&nbsp;his fascination with the universe soon outgrew the&nbsp;power of his beginner&#x2019;s telescope. He needed a larger&nbsp;instrument. But that would cost money, and his parents&nbsp;were not very wealthy.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Determined to have a more powerful telescope,&nbsp;Neil started a dog-walking service in his apartment&nbsp;building. In time, he had earned about half the money&nbsp;he needed, so his parents chipped in the rest.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neil&#x2019;s new telescope was a thing of beauty: a fivefoot-&nbsp;long tube that &#x201c;looked like a cross between an&nbsp;artillery cannon and a grenade launcher,&#x201d; as Neil once&nbsp;described it. It came with a long extension cord that had&nbsp;to be plugged into an electrical outlet. Neil also bought&nbsp;a high-tech camera so he could take photographs of the&nbsp;things he saw in the sky.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One night, Neil brought his new telescope up to the&nbsp;tar-covered roof of his building to test it out. A dentist&nbsp;who lived a few floors below let Neil plug in the cord&nbsp;inside his apartment. But a kid dragging around telescopes&nbsp;and cameras is bound to arouse suspicion. Another&nbsp;neighbor saw him, thought he was a burglar, and called&nbsp;the police.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two officers quickly arrived and climbed up to the&nbsp;roof to make sure Neil wasn&#x2019;t up to no good. Neil&nbsp;assured them that his expedition was all in the interest&nbsp;of science. He encouraged the officers to peer through&nbsp;his telescope while he told them facts about the planets: Aren't Saturn's rings amazing?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The officers had to agree. It really was pretty amazing.&nbsp;Neil continued with his astronomical investigations&nbsp;for the next several years, eventually earning admission&nbsp;to the prestigious Bronx High School of Science.&nbsp;The summer he turned fifteen, Neil signed up for &#x201c;space&nbsp;camp&#x201d; at the Hayden Planetarium, where his adventure&nbsp;had begun. For the next month, Neil studied the stars&nbsp;and talked to scientists about the universe.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He also took a class with the planetarium&#x2019;s director,&nbsp;Mark Chartrand III, who became his first role model.&nbsp;Dr. Chartrand had a way of using humorous examples to&nbsp;make complex scientific ideas understandable to everyone.&nbsp;Neil received a certificate for completing the course,&nbsp;signed by Dr. Chartrand, which he still has to this day.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On returning home from camp, Neil was asked to&nbsp;give a talk to fifty adults. He told the audience all about&nbsp;what he&#x2019;d learned at the planetarium. The sponsors of&nbsp;the talk paid Neil $50&#x2014;more money than he had ever&nbsp;earned in a single day. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one hundred dog walks!&#x201d;&nbsp;Neil marveled, thinking back to his old job.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neil&#x2019;s presentation was so poised and polished that&nbsp;other astrophysicists started to take notice of him. Carl&nbsp;Sagan, a renowned astrophysicist and host of the TV show&nbsp;<i>Cosmos</i>, wrote a letter asking Neil to consider enrolling at&nbsp;Cornell University, where Sagan taught. Neil was highly&nbsp;impressed by Professor Sagan, whose shows and books&nbsp;made things like quarks and black holes sound as cool as&nbsp;comic books and video games.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the end, Neil declined Professor Sagan&#x2019;s offer&nbsp;and decided to attend Harvard University. But their&nbsp;connection would one day be renewed. In 2015, several&nbsp;years after Carl Sagan died and Neil had succeeded him&nbsp;as America&#x2019;s best-known astrophysicist, TV producers&nbsp;asked Neil to host a new series of <i>Cosmos</i> programs.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 1996, Neil returned to the place where his love&nbsp;for astrophysics began&#x2014;the Hayden Planetarium&#x2014;but&nbsp;now he was its director, a job he still has today. Neil&nbsp;revived Dr. Chartrand&#x2019;s tradition of presenting every&nbsp;astronomy student with a graduation-style diploma. He&nbsp;signed each one, as a way of honoring the scientists who&nbsp;came before him.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like Dr. Chartrand and Professor Sagan, Neil uses&nbsp;humor and plain language to convey his enthusiasm&nbsp;for the science of astrophysics. That common touch has&nbsp;helped make Neil deGrasse Tyson one of the most&nbsp;popular and respected scientists in the world.</p><h2>How Dare the Sun Rise: Memoirs of a War Child</h2><p><p><strong>Junior Library Guild Selection * New York Public Library's Best Books for Teens * Goodreads Choice Awards Nonfiction Finalist * Chicago Public Library&#x2019;s Best of the Best Books for Teens: Nonfiction * 2018 Texas Topaz Nonfiction List * YALSA's 2018 Quick Picks List</strong>&nbsp;<strong> * Bank Street's 2018 Best Books of the Year</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;This gut-wrenching, poetic memoir reminds us that no life story can <strong>be reduced to the word &#x2018;refugee.&#x2019;" &#x2014;<em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;A critical piece of literature, contributing to the larger refugee narrative <strong>in a way that is complex and nuanced.&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>School Library Journal</em> (starred review)</strong></strong></p><p>This profoundly moving memoir is the remarkable and inspiring true story of Sandra Uwiringiyimana, a girl from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who tells the tale of how she survived a massacre, immigrated to America, and overcame her trauma through art and activism.</p><p>Sandra was just ten years old when she found herself with a gun pointed at her head.

Nearly 10 years later, that story, <i>The City of Ember,</i> is a bona fide classic, with over 1.7 million copies sold. Now experience Jeanne DuPrau's vision anew as artist Niklas Asker faithfully brings to life the glare of the lamps, the dinginess of the streets, and the brilliance of the first sunrise.</p><p>JEANNE DUPRAU is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Books of Ember series.The Instructions<br>When the city of Ember was just built and not yet inhabited, the Chief Builder and the Assistant Builder, both of them weary, sat down to speak of the future.<br><br>&#x201c;They must not leave the city for at least two hundred years,&#x201d; said the Chief Builder. &#x201c;Or perhaps two hundred and twenty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that long enough?&#x201d; asked his Assistant.<br><br>&#x201c;It should be. We can&#x2019;t know for sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And when the time comes,&#x201d; said the Assistant, &#x201c;how will they know what to do?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll provide them with instructions, of course,&#x201d; the Chief Builder replied.<br><br>&#x201c;But who will keep the instructions? Who can we trust to keep them safe and secret all that time?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The mayor of the city will keep the instructions,&#x201d; said the Chief Builder. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll put them in a box with a timed lock, set to open on the proper date.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And will we tell the mayor what&#x2019; s in the box?&#x201d; the Assistant asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No, just that it&#x2019;s information they won&#x2019;t need and must not see until the box opens of its own accord.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So the first mayor will pass the box to the next mayor, and that one to the next, and so on down through the years, all of them keeping it secret, all that time?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What else can we do?&#x201d; asked the Chief Builder. &#x201c;Nothing about this endeavor is certain. There may be no one left in the city by then or no safe place for them to come back to.&#x201d;<br><br>So the first mayor of Ember was given the box, told to guard it carefully, and solemnly sworn to secrecy. When she grew old, and her time as mayor was up, she explained about the box to her successor, who also kept the secret carefully, as did the next mayor. Things went as planned for many years. But the seventh mayor of Ember was less honorable than the ones who&#x2019;d come before him, and more desperate. He was ill&#x2013;he had the coughing sickness that was common in the city then&#x2013;and he thought the box might hold a secret that would save his life. He took it from its hiding place in the basement of the Gathering Hall and brought it home with him, where he attacked it with a hammer.<br><br>But his strength was failing by then. All he managed to do was dent the lid a little. And before he could return the box to its official hiding place or tell his successor about it, he died. The box ended up at the back of a closet, shoved behind some old bags and bundles. There it sat, unnoticed, year after year, until its time arrived, and the lock quietly clicked open.<br><br>Chapter 1<br>Assignment Day<br>In the city of Ember, the sky was always dark. The only light came from great floodlamps mounted on the buildings and at the tops of poles in the middle of the larger squares. When the lights were on, they cast a yellowish glow over the streets; people walking by threw long shadows that shortened and then stretched out again. When the lights were off, as they were between nine at night and six in the morning, the city was so dark that people might as well have been wearing blindfolds.<br><br>Sometimes darkness fell in the middle of the day. The city of Ember was old, and everything in it, including the power lines, was in need of repair. So now and then the lights would flicker and go out. These were terrible moments for the people of Ember. As they came to a halt in the middle of the street or stood stock still in their houses, afraid to move in the utter blackness, they were reminded of something they preferred not to think about: that some day the lights of the city might go out and never come back on.<br><br>But most of the time life proceeded as it always had. Grown people did their work, and younger people, until they reached the age of twelve, went to school. On the last day of their final year, which was called Assignment Day, they were given jobs to do.<br><br>The graduating students occupied Room 8 of the Ember School. On Assignment Day of the year 241, this classroom, usually noisy first thing in the morning, was completely silent. All twenty-four students sat upright and still in the desks they had grown too big for. They were waiting.<br><br>The desks were arranged in four rows of six, one behind the other. In the last row sat a slender girl named Lina Mayfleet. She was winding a strand of her long, dark hair around her finger, winding and unwinding it again and again. Sometimes she plucked at a loose thread on her ragged cape or bent over to pull on her socks, which were loose and tended to slide down around her ankles. One of her feet tapped the floor softly.<br><br>In the second row was a boy named Doon Harrow. He sat with his shoulders hunched, his eyes squeezed shut in concentration, and his hands clasped tightly together. His hair looked rumpled, as if he hadn&#x2019;t combed it for a while. He had dark, thick eyebrows, which made him look serious at the best of times, and when he was anxious or angry came together to form a straight line across his forehead. His brown corduroy jacket was so old that its ridges had flattened out.<br><br>Both the girl and the boy were making urgent wishes. Doon&#x2019;s wish was very specific. He repeated it over and over again, his lips moving slightly, as if he could make it come true by saying it a thousand times. Lina was making her wish in pictures rather than in words. In her mind&#x2019;s eye, she saw herself running through the streets of the city in a red jacket. She made this picture as bright and real as she could.</p><h2>Brunch at Bobby&#39;s: 140 Recipes for the Best Part of the Weekend: A Cookbook</h2><p><b>At long last, Bobby Flay shares his simplest, most sought-after brunch recipes&#x2014;while still delivering his signature intense flavors.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Bobby Flay may be best known for his skills at the grill, but brunch is his favorite meal of the week.

In <i>Onward</i>, he shares this remarkable story, revealing how, during one of the most tumultuous economic periods in American history, Starbucks again achieved profitability and sustainability without sacrificing humanity. <br><br>Offering you a snapshot of the recession that left no company unscathed, the book shows in riveting detail how one company struggled and recreated itself in the midst of it all. In addition, you&#x2019;ll get an inside look into Schultz's central leadership philosophy: It's not about winning, it&#x2019;s about the right way to win. <br><br><i>Onward</i> is a compelling, candid narrative documenting the maturing of a brand as well as a businessman. Ultimately, Schultz gives you a sense of hope that, no matter how tough times get, the future can be more successful than the past.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2011</strong>: <i>Onward</i> is not a puff piece. In just under 400 brisk pages, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz details the multitude of factors--the recession, new consumer behavior, overexpansion--that led to the company's downturn during 2007-2008. Obviously, Schultz was successful, and his book has plenty of valuable lessons about management and leadership--standard features for most business books. But the most interesting thing about <i>Onward</i> is Schultz's honesty about the whole process, from his determination to make difficult personnel changes to his admission that he considers it a personal failure when he sees someone with a competitor's cup of coffee. Schultz even makes the chapters about his agonies over the company's breakfast sandwiches a fascinating study in the minute decisions that go into running a multibillion-dollar company. Conflicts, raw emotions, high stakes: <i>Onward</i> is a business book that goes beyond feel-good maxims and actually has a story to tell. <i>--Darryl Campbell</i><b>Howard Schultz</b> is the chairman, president, and CEO of Starbucks and the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Pour Your Heart Into It</i>.<br><b>Joanne Gordon</b> is a former <i>Forbes</i> writer and contributing editor who has spent more than a decade profiling companies and business leaders for numerous publications and five previous books.</p><h2>Mission Defrostable (Volume 3) (Lady Pancake &amp; Sir French Toast)</h2><p><b>Our favorite breakfast food friends are back and all bready for their next adventure!

We inch along, arms above our heads to hold our weapons out of the muck. The sludge that bathes us is exquisitely rank. Gnats swarm. Mosquitoes feast and flies crawl. If my first day in the army had been like this, I'd have gone AWOL.</p><p>Behind me, I can sense my men are pissed off. We have a mission, but some of them question it. What's beyond question is the fact that I've made them come out here in the middle of the night to wade through a trench of human excrement. I glance behind me just in time to see Piotr Sucholas nearly take a header into the filth. John Ruiz slops an arm out of the sewage and catches Sucholas before he goes under. The two of them spit funk out of their mouths, then make eye contact with me for a nanosecond.</p><p>Part of me feels guilty for their plight. Knowing they're angry with me makes it even worse. Call that my human side. At the same, the professional in me, the NCO side of my brain, gives exactly two-fifths of a fuck about how my men feel. This inner conflict doesn't usually last. The NCO in me beats the ever-loving shit out of my human side. The mission is what counts.</p><p>But tonight I just can't seem to help myself.</p><p>Voice barely a whisper, I ask, "Hey, you guys alright?"</p><p>Ruiz and Sucholas nod. So does Hugh Hall who is next to Ruiz.</p><p>"Pull your nuts out. You might just die at the end of this bitch."</p><p>They stare at me without expression, streaks of shit water running down their faces. Sucholas spits again, but does so quietly. They get the point.</p><p>The fact that my men don't say a word in response shows discipline. They are angry and miserable, but they don't display it. We both play the game, soldiers and NCOs. I'm proud of their discipline, yet at the same time I am hyperalert for the first one to break the rules.</p><p>I have pushed my squad so hard in the ten months we've been in Iraq, the men must despise me. Back at base, there is a long-standing rumor of a sock full of five-dollar bills the platoon has collected, a little wager over which of their three leading sergeants will get fragged first: Fitts, Cantrell, or me.</p><p>We push along the trench. We have almost two more kilometers to go. The moonlight leads the way; it is so bright, we don't bother with our night-vision goggles. We slop our way slowly toward a large pipe that crosses the sewer trench right at head level. It is old and rusted and looks unstable. I turn around and motion to Staff Sergeant Mike Smith. Smitty edges past me in the trench and swings a leg up onto the pipe.</p><p>A metallic groan echoes through the night. Smitty tries to shift his weight and the pipe whines in protest. It starts to buckle, and a good-sized chunk falls off, leaving a gaping hole in one side. The palm groves around us are full of chained watchdogs -- the hajji version of an ADT security system. They hear the noise and bark viciously in response. The barking grows frantic. Smitty eases off the broken pipe. We can't get over it, and now we risk detection, thanks to the dogs. The whole squad freezes. I grow tense. The mission is on the line here.</p><p>We are after Ayub Ali again, the terror-for-hire arms broker who has sewn so much misery in the Diyala Province since the Shia uprising began in April. When we first arrived in country, we had no idea who he was. Gradually, through the summer, we picked up bits of intelligence that suggested there was a network providing weapons and explosives to both the Mahdi militia and the Sunni insurgents. Ayub Ali sits atop this shadowy group.</p><p>We've tried to catch him several times already, but his luck ran strong and he evaded us at every turn. The more I learn about him, the more I want him dead. He's no ideologue or jihadist, he's just a criminal selling the tools of death to the highest bidder. He helps blow up women and children for profit. Taking Ali down will save countless innocent lives.</p><p>Tonight, we are on a sneak-and-peak mission to find his latest hideout. Intelligence reports suggest Ali has moved into a horse farm in the countryside outside Muqdadiyah. Our job is to get as close as we can, get a good look at the place, and confirm he's there. The shit trench offered the surest way to approach undetected by those vicious mutts.</p><p>Now stuck at the pipe crossing our trench, we face the possibility of blowing the op altogether. In the satellite photos I received before the mission, this pipe could not be seen. Now I have to act like I expected it. We cannot backtrack. If we do, it will be the admission of a mistake, and NCOs never make mistakes. We lie like professionals to protect that image of infallibility because that is what cements us to our men.</p><p>If they believe in you and the example you set, these men will do whatever is asked of them. This connection between soldiers is a deep bond. It is the root of what it means to be an infantryman. In this cruel here and now, it is what gives my life value and meaning. That doesn't mean my men won't despise me. The nature of soldiering brings ultra-intensity to every emotion, especially in combat. We love, hate, and respect one another all at the same time, because the alternative is the bland oblivion of death.</p><p>I look at the pipe and utter a silent curse. The men are going to have to take a bath. It is the only way to continue the mission.</p><p>I had handpicked these men for this mission. I chose Specialist Lance Ohle for his mastery of the SAW light machine gun. In a firefight, Ohle on his SAW is an artist at work. He talks like a gangsta rapper but wears cowboy hats and listens to Metallica. Neither the Army nor any of those other worlds he has occupied has prepared him for this. He moans a protest about the breaststroke confronting us.</p><p>"Oh. Oohh."</p><p>"Shut the fuck up," Hugh Hall hisses.</p><p>Staff Sergeant Mike Smith stands beside me. He's our land navigation guru, though he's usually a Bradley commander, not a dismount. I nod to him and point downward, and he grimaces before taking a deep breath. An instant later, he descends into the sewage and swings around the bottom of the pipe. I hear him break the surface on the other side and exhale. Somebody hands him his weapon.</p><p>Sergeant Hall goes next. He doesn't hesitate, and I'm not surprised. I consider him one of the best soldiers in Alpha Company. He dips under the filth and pops back up on the far side of the pipe. The moonlight betrays Hall's misery. He's slick with sewage; the ochre slime drips from his Kevlar. John Ruiz sees his condition but doesn't flinch. He ducks under the pipe and breaks the surface next to Hall a second later.</p><p>I'm next. I close my eyes and hold my nose. Down into the filth I go, feeling my way under the pipe. Then I'm out the other side. Misa, Sucholas, and Sergeant Charles Knapp follow me.</p><p>We continue along the trench, more concerned about watchdogs than gunfire. Finally, we come to a stretch of palm grove that seems to be free of hajji dogs. We crawl out of the sewage and move through the grove. By now, it is 0300, and the night's chill has set in. Soaked to the bone, we start to shiver. I almost wish I was back in the shit trench. It was warmer.</p><p>We creep to a barn about 350 meters from Ali's main compound. The squad sweeps through it, hoping to find somebody to detain, but it's empty. We maneuver toward the compound. Our job is to get within view of the place, to study its layout and defenses. If possible, battalion wants us to try and flush people from the compound. If they bolt in vehicles, we can call helicopters down to follow them and others will trap them with Bradleys. Taking down these guys on the road while they're inside their cars will be easier than storming a fortified and defended compound.</p><p>On our bellies, we snake forward, bodies still shivering from the cold night air. We're just about to reach a good vantage point a hundred meters from the compound when the roar of engines shatters the stillness of the night. The cacophony grows deafening. Around us, the guard dogs howl with rage. I look over my shoulder in time to see a pair of Blackhawk helicopters thunder right over us. They hug the ground, then hover over the compound.</p><p>I hear men shouting in Arabic. A shaft of light spears the night, then another. Ali's guards are turning on searchlights. Soon the entire compound is ablaze, and the searchlights probe around us.</p><p>The birds have inadvertently compromised our mission. Cursing, we pull back to the barn, then dash into the palm grove. Behind us, the compound is fully alerted now. The guard dogs growl. The searchlights snoop. We cannot stick around. The Blackhawks dip and slide overhead. Their spinning rotors blast the buildings with mini-hurricanes of wind and dust. What was silence is now total chaos.</p><p>We hike the four kilometers back to our Brads without a word between us. This had been a perfect op until it was ruined by miscommunication with a pair of helo pilots. Stinking, frustrated, and ill-tempered, we mount up into our vehicles. We know this was our last shot at finding Ali. This mission is our swan song in the province.</p><p>Our unit is set to head out to Fallujah, a city of about 350,000 in the restive Anbar Province, along the Euphrates River. Fallujah has been under total insurgent control since April, when Operation Vigilant Resolve, a Marine offensive planned in response to the ghastly and well-publicized hanging of four U.S. contractors, was canceled for political reasons. The jarheads just loved that. All they wanted to do was finish the insurgents off once and for all. Marines. They may all be double-barreled and single-helixed. They may just be the worst historical revisionists of all time. But at their core they are fiercely proud and spoil for an unfair fight. God love 'em all.</p><p>In two days, Diyala's miseries will be behind us -- the IEDs on the local highway, the Mahdi militia around Muqdadiyah, and the house-to-house firefights downtown. We can't yet know how much we'll miss them. We are leaving the good lif...</p></p><h2>The Homesteading Handbook: A Back to Basics Guide to Growing Your Own Food, Canning, Keeping Chickens, Generating Your Own Energy, Crafting, Herbal Medicine, and More (Handbook Series)</h2><p>With the rapid depletion of our planet&#x2019;s natural resources, we would all like to live a more self-sufficient lifestyle.

Lorde announces the need for a radical politics of intersectionality while struggling to maintain her own faith as she wages a battle against liver cancer. From reflections on her struggle with the disease to thoughts on lesbian sexuality and African-American identity in a straight white man's world, Lorde's voice remains enduringly relevant in today's political landscape. <br>Those who practice and encourage social justice activism frequently quote her exhortation, "Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare." In addition to the journal entries of "A Burst of Light: Living with Cancer," this edition includes an interview, "Sadomasochism: Not About Condemnation," and three essays, "I Am Your Sister: Black Women Organizing Across Sexualities," "Apartheid U.S.A.," and "Turning the Beat Around: Lesbian Parenting 1986," as well as a new Foreword by Sonia Sanchez. <br><br>"You don't read Audre Lorde, you feel her." &#x2014; <i>Essence<br><br></i>"Lorde's timeless prose in this collection provides contemporary social justice warriors the language, strategies, and lessons around resistance, through the power of intersectionality, a Pan-African vision, and &#x2014; ultimately &#x2014; through the power of love and radical self-care." &#x2014; NBC News<br><br>"When I don't know what to do, I turn to the Lorde." &#x2014; Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Bitch Media<br><br>"Whenever my mind is heavy with questions and my heart thirsts for nourishment, I turn to the writing of Audre Lorde. Every time I revisit the words of Audre Lorde, I marvel over how relevant they continue to be." &#x2014; AfterEllen.com</p><p>"The self-described black feminist lesbian mother poet used a mixture of prose, theory, poetry, and experience to interrogate oppressions and uplift marginalized communities. She was one of the first black feminists to target heteronormativity, and to encourage black feminists to expand their understanding of erotic pleasure. She amplified anti-oppression, even as breast cancer ravaged her ailing body." &#x2014; Evette Dionne, <i>Bustle Magazine <br></i><br>"This was my first time reading Audre Lorde (finally!) and now I can't wait to devour everything she ever wrote. This was the kind of book that you end up highlighting so many great quotes, words you want to memorize, apply, breathe.

Her debut poetry collection, 1973's <i>From a Land Where Other People Live</i>, was nominated for the National Book Award and she was named New York State's Poet Laureate and received the Bill Whitehead Award for Lifetime Achievement. Other notable works include <i>The Cancer Journals</i>, her novel <i>Zami</i>, and the collection <i>Sister Outsider</i>. A member of the Black Arts Movement and a prominent advocate of the Afro-German identity during her years studying in Berlin, Lorde's writings have become increasingly influential since her death in 1992 of liver cancer.</p><h2>American History 1 (Quick Study: Academic)</h2><p>Prepare for your history exams or learn more about key events in American history with BarCharts&#x2019; updated and expanded American History 1 QuickStudy� guide.

And don&#x2019;t even get started on the new weirdness going on between his two best friends, Cyn and HeyMan.

If I did not know any better I could have easily concluded that it has been written only yesterday!'<br><br><i>Thoughts for Young Men</i> is practical, spiritual, and lively. Abounding in advice and good sense, it is still as relevant and helpful in the twenty-first century as it was when it was first published in 1865.</p><p>There are four great temptations that plague most young men: sloth, lust, love of pleasure, and peer pressure. J.C. Ryle -- the last of the great Puritans -- tackles each of these subjects with a tenderness and tact which is unsurpassed. First written toward the end of the nineteenth century, it remains to this day the most relevant and helpful book on the subject in print. I was first introduced to Ryle about fifteen years ago, and he remains my favorite teacher on personal holiness.Ryle started his ministry as curate at the Chapel of Ease in Exbury, Hampshire, moving on to become rector of St Thomas&#39;s, Winchester in 1843 and then rector of Helmingham, Suffolk the following year. While at Helmingham he married and was widowed twice. He began publishing popular tracts, and Matthew, Mark and Luke of his series of Expository Thoughts on the Gospels were published in successive years (1856-1858). His final parish was Stradbroke, also in Suffolk, where he moved in 1861, and it was as vicar of All Saints that he became known nationally for his straightforward preaching and firm defence of evangelical principles. He wrote several well-known and still-in-print books, often addressing issues of contemporary relevance for the Church from a biblical standpoint. He completed his Expository Thoughts on the Gospels while at Stradbroke, with his work on the Gospel of John (1869). His third marriage, to Henrietta Amelia Clowes in 1861, lasted until her death in 1889.</p><h2>The Peace Book</h2><p><em>Peace is making new friends.</em><em>Peace is helping your neighbor.<br>Peace is a growing a garden.<br>Peace is being who you are.</em><br><br><em>The Peace Book </em>delivers positive and hopeful messages of peace in an accessible, child-friendly format featuring Todd Parr's trademark bold, bright colors and silly scenes.

He lives with his wife and two sons in England.</p>PreS-K&#x2014;A young girl tries to negotiate with her dad about who should sleep in the "big bed." She approaches her father as if she were the boss of a company. She acts as if she is offering him a deal by providing him with alternative sleeping arrangements in exchange for his place in the "big bed." The child's ideas are captured and illustrated in wavy thought bubbles. Her proposals are interesting and she attempts to back them with facts to support her conclusions. Her approach as a negotiator and figure of authority is further alluded to with the presence of an easel, a lab coat, a pointer, photographs, and various diagrams. The young girl speaks in an adult tone with authoritative phrasing. However, her childlike point of view is evident through the nature of her dialogue. Important phrases are emphasized with cursive writing throughout the narrative. The book's cartoon illustrations feature curvy and straight lines used to create texture and dimension. The circular eyes of the characters become a focal point throughout the book. The book is filled with an array of brightly colored monochromatic backgrounds that are interchanged with white backgrounds which gives the book a fun and unpredictable feel.

But instead of jail time, Cole is given another option: attend Circle Justice, an alternative program that sends juvenile offenders to a remote Alaskan Island to focus on changing their ways. Desperate to avoid prison, Cole fakes humility and agrees to go.</p><p>While there, Cole is mauled by a mysterious white bear and left for dead. Thoughts of his abusive parents, helpless Peter, and his own anger cause him to examine his actions and seek redemption&#x2014;from the spirit bear that attacked him, from his victims, and from himself. </p></p><p>Cole Matthews is angry. Angry, defiant, smug--in short, a bully. His anger has taken him too far this time, though. After beating up a ninth-grade classmate to the point of brain damage, Cole is facing a prison sentence. But then a Tlingit Indian parole officer named Garvey enters his life, offering an alternative called Circle Justice, based on Native American traditions, in which victim, offender, and community all work together to find a healing solution. Privately, Cole sneers at the concept, but he's no fool--if it gets him out of prison, he'll do anything. Ultimately, Cole ends up banished for one year to a remote Alaskan island, where his arrogance sets him directly in the path of a mysterious, legendary white bear. Mauled almost to death, Cole awaits his fate and begins the transition from anger to humility. <p> Ben Mikaelsen's depiction of a juvenile delinquent's metamorphosis into a caring, thinking individual is exciting and fascinating, if at times heavy-handed. Cole's nastiness and the vivid depictions of the lengths he must go to survive after the (equally vivid) attack by the bear are excruciating at times, but the concept of finding a way to heal a whole community when one individual wrongs another is compelling. The jacket cover photo of the author in a bear hug with the 700-pound black bear that he and his wife adopted and raised is definitely worth seeing! (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p><p>Within Cole Matthews lie anger, rage and hate. Cole has been stealing and fighting for years. This time he caught Alex Driscal in the, parking lot and smashed his head against the sidewalk. Now, Alex may have permanent brain damage'and Cole is in the Biggest trouble of his life.</p><p>Cole is offered Circle Justice: a system based on Native American traditions that attempts to provide healing for the criminal offender, the victim and the, community. With prison as his only alternative, Cole plays along. He says he wants to repent, but in his heart Cole blames his alcoholic mom his, abusive dad, wimpy Alex -- everyone but himself -- for his situation.</p><p>Cole receives a one-year banishment to a remote Alaskan island. There, he is mauled by Mysterious white bear of Native American legend. Hideously injured, Cole waits for his death His thoughts shift from from Anger to humility. To survive, he must stop blaming others and take responsibility for his life. Rescuers arrive to save Cole's but it is the attack of the Spirit Bear that may save his soul. </p><p>Ben Mikaelsen paints a vivid picture of a juvenile offender, examining the roots without absolving solving him of responsibility for his actions, and questioning a society in which angry people make victims of their peers and communities. Touching Spirit Bear is a poignant testimonial to the power of a pain that can destroy, or lead to healing</p></p><h2>Ed Emberley&#39;s Drawing Book of Faces (REPACKAGED) (Ed Emberley Drawing Books)</h2><p>Using simple shapes, Ed Emberley shows would-be artists how to draw a variety of fun and wacky faces.

She lives in Vermont.PreS-Gr. 2. While Tacky's friends train for the winter games, he sleeps during sit-ups, pigs out on pizza and doughnuts, and goofs off late into the night. At the games, he lags behind until the ice-skating relay race and even then jeopardizes his team's chances by swallowing the baton. Though children will enjoy laughs along the way, Lester manages to bring in many facets reminiscent of the Olympics: training before the games, the march of the athletes into the stadium for the opening ceremonies that include the lighting of a torch. Of course, there are also <i>differences</i> between these games and the televised ones. For skis, the penguins strap frozen fish to their feet, and medals saying "not bad," "PRETTY GOOD," and "BIG WINNER!" are awarded for various events. Once again, Lester and Munsinger create a winning combination of action, detail, and understated wit. Librarians will want to remember this story for those hard-to-fill picture-book requests during the Olympics. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Patients, too, have turned to different doctors to alleviate their specific symptoms: an endocrinologist for a thyroid problem; a gynecologist for hormonal issues; an internist for weight, diabetes, and high blood pressure; a rheumatologist for joint problems, and even to therapists or psychologists. </p><p>While these ailments may seem unrelated, Dr. Aviva Romm contends that they are intrinsically connected by what she calls Survival Overdrive Syndrome, a condition that occurs when the body becomes overloaded. SOS can result from childhood survival patterns or adult life stressors that are compounded by foods we eat, toxins in our environment, viral infections, lack of sleep, disrupted gut microflora, and even prescribed medications. </p><p>Two of the systems most affected are the adrenal system and the thyroid, which control mood, hormones, inflammation, immunity, energy, weight, will power, blood sugar balance, cholesterol, sleep, and a host of other bodily functions. When these systems become overwhelmed they lead to symptoms that can develop into full blow illnesses, including diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and heart disease&#x2014;all of which have medically provable origins in SOS. </p><p><em>The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution</em> explains SOS, how it impacts our bodies and can lead to illness, and most importantly, offers a drug-free cure developed through Dr. Romm&#x2019;s research and clinical work with tens of thousands of patients. In as little as two weeks, you can lose excess weight, discover increased energy, improve sleep, and feel better. With <em>The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution</em>, you can rescue your metabolism, hormones, mind and mood&#x2014;and achieve long-lasting health. </p></p><p><p>Dr. Aviva Romm is a Yale-trained, board-certified family physician with a specialty in women&#x2019;s health and obstetrics; certified professional midwife; and herbalist.

The ladies of Newport had left their cards early that afternoon, some to prepare for the last and most important ball of the season, others so they could at least appear to do so. The usual clatter and bustle of Bellevue Avenue had faded away as the Four Hundred rested in anticipation of the evening ahead, leaving behind only the steady beat of the waves breaking on the rocks below. The light was beginning to go, but the heat of the day still shimmered from the white limestone fa�ades of the great houses that clustered along the cliffs like a collection of wedding cakes, each one vying with its neighbour to be the most gorgeous confection. But the hummingbird man, who wore a dusty tailcoat and a battered grey bowler in some shabby approximation of evening dress, did not stop to admire the verandah at the Breakers, or the turrets of Beaulieu, or the Rhinelander fountains that could be glimpsed through the yew hedges and gilded gates. He continued along the road, whistling and clicking to his charges in their black shrouded cages, so that they should hear a familiar noise on their last journey. His destination was the French chateau just before the point, the largest and most elaborate creation on a street of superlatives, Sans Souci, the summer cottage of the Cash family. The Union flag was flying from one tower, the Cash family emblem from the other.</p><p>He stopped at the gatehouse and the porter pointed him to the stable entrance half a mile away. As he walked to the other side of the grounds, orange lights were beginning to puncture the twilight; footmen were walking through the house and the grounds lighting Chinese lanterns in amber silk shades. Just as he turned past the terrace, he was dazzled by a low shaft of light from the dying sun refracted by the long windows of the ballroom.</p><p>In the Hall of Mirrors, which visitors who had been to Versailles pronounced even more spectacular than the original, Mrs Cash, who had sent out eight hundred invitations for the ball that night, was looking at herself reflected into infinity. She tapped her foot, waiting impatiently for the sun to disappear so that she could see the full effect of her costume. Mr Rhinehart stood by, sweat dripping from his brow, perhaps more sweat than the heat warranted.</p><p>'So I just press this rubber valve and the whole thing will illuminate?'</p><p>'Yes indeed, Mrs Cash, you just grasp the bulb firmly and all the lights will sparkle with a truly celestial effect. If I could just remind you that the moment must be short-lived. The batteries are cumbersome and I have only put as many on the gown as is compatible with fluid movement.'</p><p>'How long have I got, Mr Rhinehart?'</p><p>'Very hard to say, but probably no more than five minutes. Any longer and I cannot guarantee your safety.'</p><p>But Mrs Cash was not listening. Limits were of no interest to her. The pink evening glow was fading into darkness. It was time. She gripped the rubber bulb with her left hand and heard a slight crackle as light tripped through the one hundred and twenty light bulbs on her dress and the fifty in her diadem. It was as if a firework had been set off in the mirrored ballroom.</p><p>As she turned round slowly she was reminded of the yachts in Newport harbour illuminated for the recent visit of the German Emperor. The back view was quite as splendid as the front; the train that fell from her shoulders looked like a swathe of the night sky. She gave a glittering nod of satisfaction and released the bulb. The room went dark until a footman came forward to light the chandeliers.</p><p>'It is exactly the effect I had hoped for. You may send in your account.'</p><p>The electrician wiped his brow with a handkerchief that was less than clean, jerked his head in an approximation of a bow and turned to leave.</p><p>'Mr Rhinehart!' The man froze on the glossy parquet. 'I trust you have been as discreet as I instructed.' It was not a question.</p><p>'Oh yes, Mrs Cash. I did it all myself, that's why I couldn't deliver it till today. Worked on it every evening in the workshop when all the apprentices had gone home.'</p><p>'Good.' A dismissal. Mrs Cash turned and walked to the other end of the Hall of Mirrors where two footmen waited to open the door. Mr Rhinehart walked down the marble staircase, his hand leaving a damp smear on the cold balustrade.</p><p>In the Blue Room, Cora Cash was trying to concentrate on her book. Cora found most novels hard to sympathise with - all those plain governesses - but this one had much to recommend it. The heroine was 'handsome, clever and rich', rather like Cora herself. Cora knew she was handsome - wasn't she always referred to in the papers as 'the divine Miss Cash'? She was clever - she could speak three languages and could handle calculus. And as to rich, well, she was undoubtedly that. Emma Woodhouse was not rich in the way that she, Cora Cash, was rich. Emma Woodhouse did not lie on a lit � la polonaise once owned by Madame du Barry in a room which was, but for the lingering smell of paint, an exact replica of Marie Antoinette's bedchamber at le petit Trianon. Emma Woodhouse went to dances at the Assembly Rooms, not fancy dress spectaculars in specially built ballrooms. But Emma Woodhouse was motherless which meant, thought Cora, that she was handsome, clever, rich and free. That could not be said of Cora, who at that moment was holding the book straight out in front of her because there was a steel rod strapped to her spine. Cora's arms ached and she longed to lie down on Madame du Barry's bed but her mother believed that spending two hours a day strapped to the spine improver would give Cora the posture and carriage of a princess, albeit an American one, and for now at least Cora had no choice but to read her book in extreme discomfort.</p><p>At this moment her mother, Cora knew, would be checking the placement for the dinner she was holding before the ball, tweaking it so that her forty odd guests knew exactly how brightly they sparkled in Mrs Cash's social firmament. To be invited to Mrs Cash's fancy dress ball was an honour, to be invited to the dinner beforehand a privilege, but to be seated within touching distance of Mrs Cash herself was a true mark of distinction, and was not to be bestowed lightly. Mrs Cash liked to sit opposite her husband at dinner ever since she had discovered that the Prince and Princess of Wales always faced each other across the width not the length of the table. Cora knew that she would be placed at one end sandwiched between two suitable bachelors with whom she would be expected to flirt just enough to confirm her reputation as the belle of the season but not so much that she compromised her mother's stratagems for her future. Mrs Cash was throwing this ball to display Cora like a costly gem to be admired but not touched. This diamond was destined for a coronet, at least.</p><p>Directly after the ball the Cashes were leaving for Europe on their yacht the SS Aspen. Mrs Cash had done nothing so vulgar as to suggest that they were going there to find Cora a title; she did not, like some other ladies in Newport, subscribe to Titled Americans, a quarterly periodical which gave details of blue-blooded but impecunious young men from Europe who were looking for a rich American bride, but Cora knew that her mother's ambitions were limitless.</p><p>Cora put the novel down and shifted uncomfortably in the spine harness. Surely it was time for Bertha to come and unbuckle her. The strap across her forehead was digging in; she would look ridiculous at the ball tonight with a great red welt on her brow. She wouldn't mind in the least discomfiting her mother but she had her own reasons for wanting to look her best. Tonight was her last chance with Teddy before she had to leave for Europe. Yesterday at the picnic they had come so close, she was sure that Teddy had been about to kiss her, but her mother had found them before anything could happen. Cora smiled a little at the thought of her mother sweating as she pedalled to catch up with them. Mrs Cash had dismissed bicycles as hoydenish, until she realised that her daughter could use them to evade her, and then she had learnt to ride one in an afternoon. She might be the richest girl in America but surely she was also the most persecuted. Tonight was her coming-out party and here she was strapped into this instrument of torture. It was time she was released. In one stiff movement she rose and rang the bell.</p><p>Bertha was in the kitchen with the hummingbird man. He came from the same part of South Carolina as she did, and every year when he came up to supply the Newport hostesses with their favourite party trick, he would bring Bertha a message from what was left of her family. She had not seen any of them since the day ten years ago when she had been picked by the Reverend to go North, but sometimes when she walked through the kitchens on baking day and smelt the hot sweet smell, she thought she saw the swish of her mother's blue and white striped skirt. These days she could barely remember her mother's face but that smell would knock her back into the old cabin so fast it would bring tears to her eyes. She had sent letters at first with the presents and the money, figuring that her mother would find someone to read them to her, but now she had stopped, she didn't want some stranger reading aloud to her momma the secrets of her heart.</p><p>'Your momma said to say that your Uncle Ezra passed,' said the hummingbird man, removing his bowler hat, perhaps as a sign of respect, perhaps to impress Bertha with the noble planes of his skull. Bertha bowed her head; she had a dim memory of being carried into church on Uncle Ezra's shoulders and wondering if it was safe to hold on to the hair coming out of his ears.</p><p>'It was a fine burial, even Mrs Calhoun came to pay ...</p></p><h2>Living the Proverbs: Insights for the Daily Grind</h2><p>Swindoll offers amazingly fresh insights about how to live with inexplicable joy in spite of the daily grind.

According to tradition, Moses was divinely directed to write down foundational events in the history of the world: the creation of humans, the worldwide flood, the laws as they were handed down at Mt. Sinai, and the cycle of Israel&#x2019;s enslavement and liberation from Egypt.<br> <br>However, these stories&#x2014;and their frequent discrepancies&#x2014;provoke questions: why does the first chapter in Genesis say that man and woman were made in God&#x2019;s image, while the second says that woman was made from man&#x2019;s rib? Why does one account of the flood say it lasted forty days, while another records no less than one hundred? And why do some stories reflect the history of southern Judah, while others seem sourced from northern Israel?<br> <br>Originally published in 1987, Richard Friedman&#x2019;s <i>Who Wrote the Bible?</i> joins a host of modern scholars who show that the Pentateuch was written by at least four distinct voices&#x2014;separated by borders, political alliances, and particular moments in history&#x2014;then connected by brilliant editors. Rather than cast doubt onto the legitimacy of the Bible, Friedman uses these divergent accounts to illuminate a text that was written by real people. Friedman&#x2019;s seminal and bestselling text is a comprehensive and authoritative answer to the question: just who exactly wrote the Bible?</p><p>Richard Elliott Friedman is one of the premier bible scholars in the country. He is the Ann &amp; Jay Davis Professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Georgia and the Katzin Professor of Jewish Civilization Emeritus of the University of California, San Diego. He is the author of&nbsp;<i>Commentary on the Torah</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Disappearance of God</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Hidden Book in the Bible</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Bible with Sources Revealed, The Bible Now</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Exile and Biblical Narrative</i>, the bestselling&nbsp;<i>Who Wrote the Bible?</i>, and his newest book,&nbsp;<i>The Exodus</i>.

The first part of the book deals with dream analysis in its practical application, the problems and aims of modern psychotherapy, and also his own theory of psychological types. The middle section addresses Jung's beliefs about the stages of life and Archaic man. He also contrasts his own theories with those of Sigmund Freud.&nbsp; In the latter parts of the book Jung discusses psychology and literature and devotes a chapter to the basic postulates of analytical psychology. The last two chapters are devoted to the spiritual problem of modern man in aftermath of World War I. &nbsp;He compares it to the flowering of gnosticism in the 2nd century and investigates how psychotherapists are like the clergy.</p></p><p>No Bio&#39;He was more than a psychological or scientific phenomenon; he was to my mind one of the greatest religious phenomena the world has ever experienced.&#39; - Laurens van der Post &#39;His psychological approach is deeply interesting and should stimulate many who are today more ready to trust a doctor than a clergyman, to help them to rediscover the meaning of life.&#39; - The Guardian &#39;Jung was the first to see that, of all the crises facing humanity, the lack of any sense of meaning in life is the crisis that guarantees all the rest. Whether the reader self-defines as modern, late modern of post-modern, the predicament that Jung lays out in bleak detail still strikes a chord. His suggestion that any possible solutions - political ecological, philosophical or religious - must include and respect elements of what lies deep within the psyche (&#39;the soul&#39;) continues to challenge and to inspire.&#39; - Andrew Samuels, Professor of Analytical Psychology, University of Essex &#39;This slim volume contains the quintessence of Jung&#39;s thinking. Originally published in 1933, it was the first readily accessible presentation in English of the great psychologist&#39;s basic ideas about psychotherapy, dream interpretation, psychological types, the stages of life and his differences with Sigmund Freud. His observations on the relationship between the &#34;archaic man&#34; and &#34;modern man&#34; anticipate those of contemporary evolutionary psychiatry, while his diagnosis of what alls western culture has been endorsed by subsequent history. An invaluable book for those seeking an introduction to Jungian psychology, expressed - with unusual clarity - in the master&#39;s own words.&#39; - Anthony Stevens</p><h2>Good Morning Yoga: A Pose-by-Pose Wake Up Story (Good Night Yoga)</h2><p><p>Calm and awake, "I can do this!"</p><br><br><p>is all I need to say.</p><br><br><p>A deep breath in, a long breath out&#x2015;</p><br><br><p>I am ready for the day!</p><br><br><p>This "wake up" story is so much more than a story.

Young earned degrees in Computer Science and French at UC Davis and studied abroad in Paris and Grenoble.<p>From <em>Solo:</em></p> <p>The <em>Kama Pootra </em>begins as a personal study of reflection and meditation. Before one can understand the <em>Kama Pootra</em>, he must possess an open mind freed from any preconceived notions about bathroom behavior. The positions presented in this chapter are intended for the student alone. To begin, familiarize yourself with your surroundings: the coolness of a porcelain toilet, the contours of a tiled floor, the silken touch of toilet paper. Survey your anatomy with a close examination of what Arthur Rimbaud, the nineteenth-century French poet, referred to as the "enticing olive."* If you have never seen yourself in stark detail, try crouching over a carefully angled hand mirror.</p> <p>Once you have an understanding of your body type and anatomy, you may begin to try the basic positions of the <em>Kama Pootra</em>. It is certain that some of these tasks may be uncomfortable at first, but remember that hard work is always plentifully rewarded in the bathroom.</p> <p>The Gold Standard</p> <p>The Gold Standard is the foundation for all poop studies included in this book. When boys and girls enter into bathroom maturity-a good number by age three and some prodigious children as early as six months-this basic position is the first pose taught in Western toilet centric cultures. It is remarkable for its simplicity and undemanding physical nature. A famous Zimbabwean proverb stipulates, "If you can speak, you can sing. If you can walk, you can dance." Likewise: if you can sit, you can poop.</p> <p>The Thinker</p> <p>This is the premier position for deep contemplation. Many of the great philosophers in history used bathroom time to formulate theories about human nature. Take time to ponder life's greatest questions:</p> <p>� What is the source of my happiness?</p> <p>� Am I eating healthy enough?</p> <p>� When did I eat so much corn?</p> <p>90 Degrees</p> <p>This position utilizes the full curvature of the toilet seat for a more well-rounded experience. Students with larger bottoms (water buffalo or elephants) will find that the 90 Degrees position is more comfortable because additional width is afforded by sitting perpendicular. This position is also useful for unsecured restrooms in that it allows greater options to observe the door directly.</p> <p>The Lotus</p> <p>This position is achieved by intertwining the legs upon the toilet seat to gain what the maharishis call "toilet levitation." The Lotus position is an excellent way to meditate and release the stresses and anxieties that build up from a modern caloric intake. Meditation in concert with a full release can elevate the consciousness to a plane approaching bathroom nirvana.</p> <p>The Reverse</p> <p>The Reverse position offers the student a new perspective of the bathroom, a 180, if you will, from the traditional positions of the <em>Kama Pootra. </em>By simply turning around from the standard position, the back is given a free range of motion should the student need to lean back or contort herself. From this position one can assume complete control of the toilet. A "drop and flush" maneuver can be completed in one fluid motion as the toilet is brought under quick and easy control.</p> <p>The Breast Exam</p> <p>An important aspect of the <em>Kama Pootra </em>is maintaining a healthy body. The <em>Kama Pootra </em>views the physical body as a sacred poop vault that must not be neglected. Harboring toxins and illness impairs the ability to harness maximum pleasure from a healthy poop experience. Maintaining a clean lifestyle and routinely performing self-screenings are simple proactive ways to retain the <em>Kama Pootra</em>'s full potential. While the most dangerous foe of the <em>Kama Pootra </em>is no doubt colon cancer, women should use this position at least once a month to check for unexpected lumps and hard masses. Your next poop may save your life </p> <p>The Airplane Crash</p> <p>This position is fashioned after the airplane safety manual, which-in the event of a crash-advises that the head should be placed between the legs, arms interlocked under the knees. If needed, grab your ankles for leverage as you anxiously proceed in making a water landing.</p></p><h2>21-Day Weight Loss Kickstart: Boost Metabolism, Lower Cholesterol, and Dramatically Improve Your Health</h2><p>For years, Dr. Neal D.

For more information about Joseph, please visit his website www.josephbruchac.com.Kindergarten-Grade 4-- The book opens with an Abenaki storyteller explaining to his grandson that just as there are always 13 scales on ``Old Turtle's back,'' there are 13 moons in a year, each of which has a name and a story. The poetic tales and corresponding paintings that follow represent myths or legends of different Native American tribes. Although the language of these poems is not particularly memorable or childlike, it does evoke images and passes on some of the traditions of the native people and their closeness to the natural world. The cadence is that of an adult explaining things to a child. Both text and illustrations have a distancing effect on readers. Locker's large, dark paintings stand parallel to or in tandem with the poems but are not integral to them. They create a mood and capture portions of the text, encouraging viewers to look ``at'' rather than ``into'' these images. There is a sense of vastness in these paintings, and sometimes a harshness, but little of the lushness or the warmth of the land. Although the cover illustration of the turtle is inviting and the large format attractive, these are poems that will probably not entice most youngsters on their own. They can be appreciated, however, when presented by an adult and will be a welcome addition to units on Native American cultures. --Kay E.

Officer T.J. Banks pulled the car onto the shoulder and flipped on the spotlight, running the beam along the edge of the field where corn stalks shivered in the cold. Twenty yards away, six Jersey cows stood in the bar ditch, chewing their cud.</p><p>"Stupid fuckin' cows," he muttered. Besides chickens, they had to be the dumbest animals on earth.</p><p>He hit the radio. "Dispatch, this is forty-seven."</p><p>"What's up, T.J.?" asked Mona, the night dispatcher.</p><p>"I got a 10-54. Stutz's damn cows are out again."</p><p>"That's the second time in a week."</p><p>"Always on my shift, too."</p><p>"So what are you going to do? He ain't got no phone out there."</p><p>A glance at the clock on the dash told him it was nearly two A.M. "Well, I'm not going to stand out here in the frickin' cold and round up these stupid shits."</p><p>"Maybe you ought to just shoot 'em."</p><p>"Don't tempt me." Looking around, he sighed. Livestock on the road at this hour was an accident waiting to happen. If someone came around the curve too fast it could be bad. He thought of all the paperwork an accident would entail and shook his head. "I'll set up some flares then go drag his Amish ass out of bed."</p><p>"Let me know if you need backup." She snickered.</p><p>Yanking the zipper of his coat up to his chin, he slid his flashlight from its nest beside the seat and got out of the cruiser. It was so cold he could feel his nose hairs freezing. His boots crunched through snow as he made his way to the bar ditch, his breaths puffing out in front of him. He hated the graveyard shift almost as much as he hated winter.</p><p>He ran the flashlight beam along the fence line. Sure enough, twenty feet away two strands of barbed wire had come loose from a gnarled locust-wood post. Hoofprints told him several head had discovered the opening and ventured onto the shoulder for some illicit grazing.</p><p>"Stupid fuckin' cows."</p><p>T.J. went back to the cruiser and popped the trunk. Removing two flares, he set them up on the centerline to warn traffic. He was on his way back to the cruiser when he spotted something in the snow on the opposite side of the road. Curious, he crossed to it. A solitary woman's shoe lay on the shoulder. Judging from its condition and lack of snow cover, it hadn't been there long. Teenagers, probably. This deserted stretch of road was a favorite place to smoke dope and have sex. They were almost as stupid as cows.</p><p>Frowning, T.J. nudged the shoe with his foot. That was when he noticed the drag marks, as if something heavy had been hauled through the snow. He traced the path with the flashlight beam, tracking it to the fence and into the field beyond. The hairs at the back of his neck prickled when he spotted blood. A lot of it.</p><p>"What the hell?"</p><p>He followed the trail into the ditch where yellow grass poked up through the snow. He climbed the fence and found more blood on the other side, stark and black against pristine white. It was enough to give a guy the willies.</p><p>The path took him to a stand of bare-branched hedge apple trees at the edge of a cornfield. He could hear himself breathing hard, the dead corn stalks whispering all around. T.J. set his hand on his revolver and swept the beam in a 360-degree circle. That was when he noticed the object in the snow.</p><p>At first he thought an animal had been hit and dragged itself there to die. But as he neared, the beam revealed something else. Pale flesh. A shock of darkish hair. A bare foot sticking out of the snow. Adrenaline kicked hard in his gut. "Holy shit."</p><p>For an instant he couldn't move. He couldn't stop looking at the dark circle of blood and colorless flesh. Giving himself a hard mental shake, T.J. dropped to his knees beside the body. His first thought was that she might still be alive. Brushing at the snow, he set his hand against a bare shoulder. Her skin was ice cold, but he rolled her over anyway. He saw more blood and pasty flesh and glazed eyes that seemed to stare right at him.</p><p>Shaken, he scrambled back. His hand trembled as he grappled for his lapel mike. "Dispatch! This is forty-seven!"</p><p>"What now, T.J? One of them cows chase you up a tree?"</p><p>"I got a fuckin' body here at Stutz's place."</p><p><i>"What?"</i></p><p>They used the ten-code system in Painters Mill, but for the life of him he couldn't remember the number for a dead body. He'd never had to use it. "I said I got a dead body."</p><p>"I heard you the first time." But the words were followed by a stunned pause as realization hit her. "What's your twenty?"</p><p>"Dog Leg Road, just south of the covered bridge."</p><p>A beat of silence. "Who is it?"</p><p>Everyone knew everyone in Painters Mill, but he'd never seen this woman before. "I don't know. A woman. Naked as the day she came into this world and deader than Elvis."</p><p>"A wreck or what?"</p><p>"This was no accident." Setting his hand on the butt of his .38, T.J. scanned the shadows within the trees. He could feel his heart beating fast in his chest. "You'd better call the chief, Mona. I think we got us a murder."</p><p>SWORN TO SILENCE.

Read how Chiara Luce, an Italian high school student, faced cancer joyfully, inspiring thousands to throng her funeral in song.

Through prayers, images, and maps, catch a glimpse of a saint's world that carries lessons for our own--and discover how you can set our world ablaze with love for the Lord!</p></p><p>Colleen Swaim is a teacher of religion and English in the Diocese of Covington, Kentucky, who encourages in young adults an understanding of the intense radicalism of sanctity and the dreary dullness of sin.Young people and others will appreciate another book that matters, in both content and design: Ablaze: Stories of Daring Teen Saints, by Colleen Swaim. This book is a gem, plain and simple. Here are just three of the best elements: *the book include several well-known saints, like St. Dominic Savio and St. Maria Goretti, but these bios aren&#x2019;t the &#x201c;same-old&#x201d; facts. Swaim infuses the stories with a fresh, invigorating voice that shows these remarkable people as more 3-dimensional than the usual narratives. *the bulk of the book is new-to-most saints, or saints most will only have a passing knowledge of, from St. Kitizio of Africa to Blessed Chiara of Italy, and many others. Their stories are told in a way that makes Ablaze a must-read. It truly inspires a sense of longing for holiness. *each saint/chapter ends with &#x201c;saintly challenges,&#x201d; offering readers a chance to apply the lessons of the saint&#x2019;s life to his or her own, through media, prayers and recipes. Think trying a homemade chai tea recipe to give as a gift after reading about St. Alphonsa from India, or being challenged to put into practice a daily schedule to emulate St. Stantislaus. There are movie suggestions, simple virtue development ideas, and tons of other great ideas and challenges.

The aim is a spiritual awakening for youth, so they&#x2019;ll become wholehearted Catholics. How about role models who have already made the journey? Here&#x2019;s a collection of stories about young heroes for inspiration: ""Ablaze: Stories of Daring Teen Saints," by Colleen Swaim&#x201c;Ablaze: Stories of Daring Teen Saints&#x201d; by high school teacher Colleen Swaim, is about eight teenagedsaints or &#x201c;blesseds&#x201d; recognized officially by the church. (Of course there are many more whose names we&#x2019;ll never know.) Three of Swaim&#x2019;s subjects were from Italy, and the other five from Chile, Uganda, Poland, India and Spain. The youngest is 11-year-old St. Maria Goretti. Swaim writes about some who were obvious saints from the get-go, like Dominic Savio who served Mass daily at age five. Or Stanislaus Kostka, a home-schooled kid in 1564 who levitated during Mass at age 14. Or young Kizito. He lived in Uganda and was a page in the court of an evil king who also happened to be a pedophile. Kizito, newly baptized at age 14, went singing to his martyrdom, along with 15 other boys and young men, St. Charles Lwanga and some adult Christians. But when Juanita Solar was a youngster, she was rich, spoiled and had temper tantrums. (Nothing too saintly there.) A typical student, she called her boarding school &#x201c;a dungeon,&#x201d; and hated to go back after summer break. People can change. Juanita entered a Carmelite convent at age 18 and while her life was brief, today she&#x2019;s known as the &#x201c;St. Teresa of the Andes.&#x201d; The most recent addition to this select company is Chiara &#x201c;Luce&#x201d; Badano. Called &#x201c;a saint of our times,&#x201d; she&#x2019;s been chosen by Pope Benedict as one of the patrons for World Youth Day 2011. Before she died of bone cancer at age 18, she &#x201c;lived the Gospel&#x201d; doing acts of love for others. She appeared average &#x2015; hanging out in coffee shops with friends, playing tennis and swimming. She might even be called &#x201c;the saint who flunked high school math.&#x201d; She offered all her suffering to God, and 20 years after her death, in 2010, she was named Blessed Chiara. Swaim has arranged her appealing book with lots of extra tidbits from helpful definitions and photos to brief discussion-starters, saintly challenges and prayers.

It is a privilege to be able to explore the realities of the world of the Bible with so many students who are eager to learn on-site. There are clear connections between the ways that the people who lived in the lands of the Bible thought about God and organized their lives in ancient times, and how folks living in the same places respond to the Divine tug today. The longer I live in Jerusalem, the more I am learning to appreciate the consistent call of God on His people, and our responsibility to live whole lives that are characterized by shalom, the peace that only He can give."</p> <p>sha'alu shalom yerushalayim, yishlayu ohavyich "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem, may those who love you be at ease . . ." (Psalm 122:6)</p><p><i>"In this integration of biography, history and geography, Paul Wright applies his considerable knowledge of the land to the life and times of people in both the Old and New Testaments. In his capable hands readers will see the characters of the Bible come to life in the context of the very real world in which they lived. Whether readers have been through the Bible fifty times or this is their first, the pictures, maps and extremely readable text will lead them to fresh insight into this greatest of stories."</i> --Dr. John Walton, Professor of Old Testament, Wheaton College<br><br>The Rose Then and Now Bible Map Atlas by Dr. Paul H. Wright is a tremendous new resource for students, pastors, and biblical scholars. As noted in the title, the atlas contains a well-known but under-appreciated feature, the integration of a clear modern- day overlay for the main maps. As many professors can attest, geography, even modern, is far from a strong suit of many students, and the integration of the ancient and modern map is definitely needed to help orient readers to where the biblical stories took place and how that connects with today s landscape. Beyond the expected features of any atlas clear, visually compelling maps, timelines, and site photos Wright s work displays a number of key strengths that flow from the unique combination of his educational background and his years of living in the land. First, the Atlas, shows a keen awareness of significant academic issues in the study of the land and brings those to light in a user-friendly way. The cautious comparisons of ancient pastoralists to traditional Bedouin is one prime example. Second, the work with its deep academic underpinnings in the modern study of history and culture, also displays a remarkably adept handling of the theological significance of the land in general and the setting of particular stories, as well as the literary use of geographical features in the various narratives of both the Old and New Testaments. Finally, it is clear from the photos, the comments on the sites, and the depth of knowledge that Wright s acquaintance with the land comes not just from decades of reading, but from years of living, studying, and teaching in the land. The first hand experience is evident on virtually every page. This is a book that I would highly recommend for anyone looking for help understanding the role of the physical setting of the Bible, the cultural milieu across the centuries it covers, and the unique literary usage of place in the narratives of the both the Old and New Testament. Wright is to be commended for producing such a clear, nuanced, and accurate text, and Rose should be thanked for making it available to us in such an attractive and helpful format. --J. Michael Thigpen, Executive Director of the Evangelical Theological Society Thigpen, Evangelical Theological Society (ETS)<br><br>This is a terrific volume for reading the Bible and its cast of characters in context. The combination of text and illustration is wonderful. Among the chapters, I was particularly taken with the treatment of Ruth, Naomi, and Boaz, and the way that Wright was able to take these minor characters and assist readers in a fuller grasp of a classic tale. (This review was of the original edition, Greatness, Grace, and Glory, which did not have the clear plastic overlays.) --Dr. J.

With the rest they can take their time.&#x201d; </i>So begins Toni Morrison&#x2019;s <i>Paradise</i>, which opens with a horrifying scene of mass violence and chronicles its genesis in an all-black small town in rural Oklahoma. Founded by the descendants of freed slaves and survivors in exodus from a hostile world, the patriarchal community of Ruby is built on righteousness, rigidly enforced moral law, and fear. But seventeen miles away, another group of exiles has gathered in a promised land of their own. And it is upon these women in flight from death and despair that nine male citizens of Ruby will lay their pain, their terror, and their murderous rage.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In prose that soars with the rhythms, grandeur, and tragic arc of an epic poem, Toni Morrison challenges our most fiercely held beliefs as she weaves folklore and history, memory and myth into an unforgettable meditation on race, religion, gender, and a far-off past that is ever present.&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, January 1998</b>: Toni Morrison's <i>Paradise</i> takes place in the tiny farming community of Ruby, Oklahoma, which its residents proudly proclaim "the one all-black town worth the pain." Settled by nine African American clans during the 1940s, the town represents a small miracle of self-reliance and community spirit. Readers might be forgiven, in fact, for assuming that Morrison's title refers to Ruby itself, which even during the 1970s retains an atmosphere of neighborliness and small-town virtue. Yet Paradises are not so easily gained. As we soon discover, Ruby is fissured by ancestral feuds and financial squabbles, not to mention the political ferment of the era, which has managed to pierce the town's pious isolation. In the view of its leading citizens, these troubles call for a scapegoat. And one readily exists: the Convent, an abandoned mansion not far from town--or, more precisely, the four women who occupy it, and whose unattached and unconventional status makes them the perfect targets for patriarchal ire. ("Before those heifers came to town," the men complain, "this was a peaceable kingdom.") One July morning, then, an armed posse sets out from Ruby for a round of ethical cleansing. <p> <i>Paradise</i> actually begins with the arrival of these vigilantes, only to launch into an intricate series of flashbacks and interlaced stories. The cast is large--indeed, it seems as though we must have met all 360 members of Ruby's populace--and Morrison knows how to imprint even the minor players on our brains. Even more amazing, though, are the full-length portraits she draws of the four Convent dwellers and their executioners: rich, rounded, and almost painful in their intimacy. This richness--of language and, ultimately, of human understanding--combats the aura of saintliness that can occasionally mar Morrison's fiction. It also makes for a spectacular piece of storytelling, in which such biblical concepts as redemption and divine love are no postmodern playthings but matters of life and (in the very first sentence, alas) death.</p>Praise for Toni Morrison reading <b>Sula</b><p>"Toni Morrison's speaking voice contains the same musicality as her prose, and the combination of the two results in a nearly sublime experience." <br>- The Chicago Tribune</p><p>". . . it's a storyteller's voice - older than sound recording, older even than print itself." <br>-The Trenton Times</p><p>"Morrison's remarkable talent for storytelling naturally lends itself to the spoken word."<br> - The Arizona Republic</p></p><h2>The Common Core Companion: The Standards Decoded, Grades K-2: What They Say, What They Mean, How to Teach Them (Corwin Literacy)</h2><p><p><strong>It&#x2019;s the <em>teaching</em> around the standards that counts!</strong></p> <p>What makes Sharon Taberski&#x2019;s <em>Common Core Companion</em> "that version of the standards you wish you had?"

Based on research but made practical for today&#x2019;s leader, <i>The Trust Edge </i>shows that trust is quantifiable and brings dramatic results to businesses and leaders. In this book, Horsager teaches readers how to build the 8 Pillars of Trust: <br><br><b>1. Clarity: </b>People trust the clear and mistrust the ambiguous. <br><br><b>2. Compassion: </b>People put faith in those who care beyond themselves. <br><br><b>3. Character: </b>People notice those who do what is right over what is easy. <br><br><b>4. Competency: </b>People have confidence in those who stay fresh, relevant, and capable. <br><br><b>5. Commitment: </b>People believe in those who stand through adversity. <br><br><b>6. Connection: </b>People want to follow, buy from, and be around friends. <br><br><b>7. Contribution: </b>People immediately respond to results. <br><br><b>8. Consistency: </b>People love to see the little things done consistently. <br><br>When leaders learn how to implement these pillars, they enjoy better relationships, reputations, retention, revenue, and results. Fascinating and timely, <i>The Trust Edge </i>unveils how trust has the ability to accelerate or destroy any business, organization, or relationship. The lower the trust, the more time everything takes, the more everything costs, and the lower the loyalty of everyone involved. Conversely, an environment of trust leads to greater innovation, morale, and productivity. The trusted leader is followed. From the trusted salesperson, people will buy. For the trusted brand, people will pay more, come back, and tell others.
